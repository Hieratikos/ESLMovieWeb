  </div>
<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
    This is a classic film, and a great reflection of the anxiety-filled times in which
    it was produced. It is the story of a group of American soldiers who are captured
    during the Korean War, and secretly taken to Manchuria, China. There, they are
    brainwashed by a group of communist Chinese officials, who have learned the latest
    in mind control, the subconscious, and modern psychology from their Russian allies.
    After just a few days, the soldiers are released, but because of the brainwashing,
    they mistakenly believe that they had escaped in a hard fought battle and that Raymond
    was the hero who was most responsible for their freedom.
<p>
    In reality, all of them had been drugged and psychologically manipulated before being
    released, and Raymond in particular had been chosen to later serve as a spy for his
    Chinese and Russian “bosses.” Of course, because nobody knows when they’ve been brainwashed,
    Raymond is totally unaware of what he is doing and how he is being used. Thus, he comes
    home as part American war hero and part communist robot.
<p>
    In the years after the war, Major Marco begins to have the same nightmare about his experience
    in Korea, and  he slowly realizes that in fact, Raymond is not a real war hero; he is a brainwashed
    communist killer who is not aware of his own actions. Nobody in the army seems to believe Marco,
    but as other soldiers soon tell of the same nightmares and confused memories, it gradually becomes
    clear that something terrible is happening, and that in fact, Raymond’s Chinese and Russian controllers
    are going to use him to not only spy, but to do everything they can to take control of the American government.
<p>
    <em><strong>Some Brief background about the Korean War and the Cold War:</strong></em>  The Korean War was fought between 1950 and 1953,
    and it was the first major battle between the American lead capitalist West and the Russian lead communists.
    The communist Chinese fought actively on the side of the communist North Koreans, and the Americans had entered
    the war in defense of the South Koreans. In this film, the Chinese take the Americans prisoner and send
    them to Manchuria in order to be brainwashed (Manchuria is a large province in Northern China).
    <p>
    For this film, more important than the Korean War is the presence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a>,
    the great battle for influence and power in the world,  between the capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union. In the 1950s, many
    Americans were convinced that communists were everywhere within the US government, and some politicians (especially
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy" target="_blank">Senator Joe McCarthy</a>) built their entire
    careers on scaring people into such a belief. These conspiracy theories destroyed many peoples' lives, and it is
  within this historical context that The Manchurian Candidate was made, and ultimately, the film itself is a great
  reflection of America’s greatest fears during those tense Cold War years.

<p>
  <p><strong>New Words and Expressions:</strong></p>
  <p></p>
<p><em><strong>Come on</strong>, <strong>Sarge</strong>, Gertrude'll buy you a beer.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Come on&rdquo; is the most versatile phrasal verb in all of English, meaning everything from hurry up to, as in this case, be reasonable. &ldquo;Sarge&rdquo; is short for Sergeant, which is a mid-level enlisted rank in the US Army.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s so bad about it? :: <strong>Tricky</strong>. <strong>Swamp</strong> all around.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a situation is &ldquo;tricky,&rdquo; it is difficult or possibly dangerous. A &ldquo;swamp&rdquo; is a wetland covered by water, grasses and woody vegetation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nobody said anything about <strong>quicksand</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A type of loose sand in which anything that goes on it starts to sink into it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The next 200 <strong>yards</strong>. :: Reject. It&rsquo;s not <strong>tactical</strong> to travel forward in a single line.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;yard&rdquo; is a unit of measurement about three feet long. If something is &ldquo;tactical,&rdquo; it is thought to help advance a general plan or larger purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ok, <strong>pass the word</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of saying &ldquo;tell other people.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The nation jealously guards its highest award for <strong>valor</strong>; The Congressional Medal of Honor.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A powerful word meaning great bravery or courage.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>With 5,770,000 men <strong>engaged</strong>, only 77 men were so honored.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; means actively involved in (of the millions who served in the military during the Korean War, 77 won the Congressional Medal of Honor--about 1.8 million people served "in theater", which means to be actually in the area of war operations).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Staff Sergeant</strong> Raymond Shaw&hellip;was flown from <strong>combat</strong> directly to Washington D.C., to be <strong>decorated</strong> personally by the President of the United States.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;staff sergeant&rdquo; is a mid-level enlisted rank in the Army. &ldquo;Combat&rdquo; refers to the actual fighting during a war. To be "decorated" in the military means to be given a medal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The presence of any Medal of Honor winner is <strong>sufficient</strong> to bring <strong>Generals</strong> to their feet, <strong>saluting</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something is &ldquo;sufficient,&rdquo; it is just enough for what is needed. A &ldquo;General&rdquo; is the highest officer rank of the Army, and &ldquo;to salute&rdquo; is to bring your hand to your forehead while addressing a superior or someone in the military.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Senator, how about a <strong>statement</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An important word for an official remark or declaration, often made to the news media.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Senator is Raymond&rsquo;s <strong>step-father</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your step-father is the husband of your mom, but not your own father.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You organized this <strong>three ring circus</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Literally, a giant circus with three large tents, but more generally, any planned event that is considered ridiculous, often because it is a huge waste of money and time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve been a <strong>mess</strong> the last few months.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is a &ldquo;mess,&rdquo; they are usually in very bad physical or emotional state, or having great trouble just taking care of themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Say &lsquo;<strong>cheese</strong>.&rsquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The one word that people are supposed to say when their picture is being taken so that it will look as if they are smiling.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why, you <strong>publicity sick</strong>&hellip;.<strong>boob</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;publicity sick,&rdquo; they desperately want to be in the news. A &ldquo;boob&rdquo; is a slang word for a stupid person (and for a female breast).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Who&rsquo;s kidding who?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of saying that no one really believes what is being said.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve got it all <strong>figured out</strong>, haven&rsquo;t you?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To figure out&rdquo; a problem is to find the solution to it, usually after thinking about it quite seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>His <strong>citation</strong>, <strong>attested to</strong> by his <strong>commanding officer</strong>, Captain Bennett Marco, and the nine surviving members of his <strong>patrol</strong>, read in part&hellip;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, a &ldquo;citation&rdquo; is an official statement of respect for having done something brave, and if a statement is &ldquo;attested to&rdquo; by someone, it is claimed to be true by them. A soldier&rsquo;s &ldquo;commanding officer&rdquo; is the leader who is in charge of them, and a &ldquo;patrol&rdquo; is a group of soldiers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;.<strong>Displaying valor</strong> beyond the <strong>call of duty</strong>, did <strong>single handedly</strong> save the lives of nine members of his patrol, capturing an enemy machine <strong>gun nest</strong>&hellip;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To display valor&rdquo; is to show great courage. &ldquo;The call of duty&rdquo; is an official way of referring to what is expected of a person in a particular job or position. To do something &ldquo;single-handedly&rdquo; is to do it without the help of others, and a &ldquo;gun nest&rdquo; of enemy soldiers is a group of them in an armed, defended location.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;and <strong>taking out</strong> in the process a full company of enemy <strong>infantry</strong>.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to take out&rdquo; a group of enemy soldiers is to kill them, and &ldquo;infantry&rdquo; is a military word for any solider who fights on foot.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He then <strong>proceeded to</strong> lead his patrol, which had been listed as <strong>missing&nbsp;in action</strong> for three days, back through the <strong>enemy lines</strong> to safety.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To proceed to&rdquo; do something is to start to do it. If a solider is &ldquo;missing in action,&rdquo; they cannot be found, and may be dead or taken prisoner. &ldquo;Enemy lines&rdquo; refers to the farthest advance that enemy soldiers have made into an area of land.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anything to take the pain out of <strong>campaigning</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In a political context, &ldquo;to campaign&rdquo; is to endlessly travel around making speeches, trying to get voters to voter for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s not a <strong>communist</strong>, mother. As a matter of fact, he&rsquo;s a <strong>Republican</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this film, a &ldquo;communist&rdquo; is a believer in the political system of the old Soviet Union and China during the Cold War. A &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; is a member of the Republican Party, which generally speaking, is and was more anti-Communist and conservative than the Democratic party.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What could you possibly have in common with that <strong>dreadful</strong> old man?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An excellent word for awful, horrible or totally depressing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For one thing, we discovered that we both <strong>loath</strong> and <strong>despise</strong> you and Johnny.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To loath&rdquo; a person is to hate them with great passion or anger. &ldquo;To despise&rdquo; means the same thing as to loath, though it&rsquo;s more common.</li>
</ul>

<div class="w3-col s2"><p></p></div>
<div class="w3-col s8 w3-theme w3-center" style="font-style:italic;"><h4>Major Marco is haunted by nightmares of Korea and Raymond’s actions
  while there, and soon Marco is transferred to a public relations job.</h4></div>
<div class="w3-col s2"><p></p></div>
</div>
</p>
<p><em>The war in Korea was over. <strong>Captain</strong>, now <strong>Major</strong> Bennett Marco, had been <strong>reassigned</strong> to <strong>Army intelligence</strong> in Washington.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Captain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Major&rdquo; are two ranks or levels of position in the military. &ldquo;To reassign&rdquo; a person is to place them in another job (which in this case is in another place). &ldquo;Army intelligence&rdquo; refers to that part of the army responsible for spying and collecting information on others.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It was, <strong>by and large</strong>, a <strong>pleasant</strong> assignment.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;By and large&rdquo; means generally speaking, and if something is &ldquo;pleasant,&rdquo; it is enjoyable or pleasing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Night after night, the major was <strong>plagued</strong> by the same <strong>recurring</strong> nightmare.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;plagued&rdquo; by something, they are greatly worried or disturbed by it. If a nightmare is &ldquo;recurring,&rdquo; it happens over and over.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I noticed <strong>magnificent hydrangeas</strong> on the hills, where the <strong>drainage</strong> was perfect, and very poor <strong>specimens</strong> or perhaps nothing at all in the valleys.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Magnificent&rdquo; is an alternative to wonderful or splendid. &ldquo;Hydrangeas&rdquo; are a type of plant, &ldquo;drainage&rdquo; is the ability of water to flow away, and &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; is a scientific word for a single animal or plant that belongs to a larger group or classification.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thus it was the hydrangea that gave the first <strong>pointer</strong> in another discovery of <strong>horticultural</strong> importance.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; is a clue, or a small amount of information that serves to instruct. &ldquo;Horticulture&rdquo; refers to the study of plants and gardening.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A number of varieties originally found in Japan, not all of which, of course, have the same <strong>characteristics</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; refers to a quality, such as, in this case, the ability to live a long time without water.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Allow me to introduce our American visitors&mdash;I must ask you to forgive their somewhat <strong>lackadaisical manner</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person has a &ldquo;lackadaisical manner,&rdquo; they have no real energy, passion or spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I have <strong>conditioned</strong> them, or <strong>brainwashed</strong> them, which I understand is the new American word.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To condition&rdquo; a person is to train or teach them to respond in a certain way to certain situations. &ldquo;To brainwash&rdquo; is a very powerful verb which means to use psychological means to totally change the way a person thinks, so that they will accept things they wouldn&rsquo;t normally (such as a new religion or philosophy) and do things that they may not even be aware that they are doing. A critical verb for this film.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They believe they are <strong>waiting out</strong> a storm in the <strong>lobby</strong> of a small hotel in New Jersey, where a meeting of the Ladies Garden Club is in progress.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To wait out&rdquo; a storm is to wait for it to end. &ldquo;The lobby&rdquo; of a hotel is the open hallway or large room where guests often check in.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve allowed my people to have a little fun in the selection of <strong>bizarre</strong> <strong>tobacco</strong> substitutes.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Bizarre&rdquo; means very strange or odd. &ldquo;Tobacco&rdquo; is the plant used to make cigarettes, and thus this may be a reference to drugs like marijuana.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now then, <strong>comrades</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A word popular among communists that basically meant fellow citizen.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve flown 8,000 miles to a <strong>dreary</strong> spot in <strong>Manchuria</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A good word for gray and depressing. Manchuria is a province in Northern China.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all heard the <strong>old wives tale</strong> that no <strong>hypnotized subject</strong> may be forced to do that which is <strong>repellant</strong> to his <strong>moral nature</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;old wives tale&rdquo; is a generally believed fact or story that is not true. If a person is &ldquo;hypnotized,&rdquo; they are put in a type of subconscious state where they could become easily influenced to do things they wouldn&rsquo;t normally do. A &ldquo;subject&rdquo; is a person in an experiment. If something is &ldquo;repellant,&rdquo; it is disgusting or very disagreeable, and a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral nature&rdquo; is a way of referring to what they believe to be right and wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You note takers might&hellip;.<strong>consult</strong> Brennan&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Anti-Social and <strong>Self-Injurious</strong>&nbsp;Behavior.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To consult&rdquo; an academic paper is to read or study it. If a person&rsquo;s behavior is &ldquo;self-injurious,&rdquo; they are hurting or harming themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If it offends you, only <strong>the West</strong> is working to <strong>manufacture</strong> more crime and better criminals.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the context of the Cold War, &ldquo;the West&rdquo; generally referred to the US and its European allies, and &ldquo;to manufacture&rdquo; means to produce or create.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My dear Yen, as you grow older, you grow more <strong>long-winded</strong>&mdash;Can&rsquo;t we <strong>get to the point</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;long-winded,&rdquo; they tend to talk on and on. If a person &ldquo;gets to the point,&rdquo; they say exactly what it is they are trying to communicate, rather than talking in stories or analogies.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I keep forgetting&hellip;your <strong>attention span</strong> is limited.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A person&rsquo;s &ldquo;attention span&rdquo; refers to the maximum amount of time they are able to concentrate on one thing. Yen is basically calling the complainer a stupid person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Raymond has been a <strong>crack shot</strong> since childhood.:: <strong>Marvelous outlet</strong> for his aggression.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;crack shot&rdquo; is a person who is able to shoot a gun with great accuracy. &ldquo;Marvelous&rdquo; is another word for wonderful or great, and an &ldquo;outlet&rdquo; is an opening through which something, such an anger, can be let out.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>May I have the <strong>bayonet</strong> please?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A large steel blade, frequently attached to the end of a rifle for close-quarters combat.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You notice that he is always <strong>drawn to authority</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;drawn to authority,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re attracted to powerful people.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now then Raymond, take this <strong>scarf</strong> and <strong>strangle</strong> Ed Malvole.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;scarf&rdquo; is a cloth worn around one&rsquo;s head or neck. "To strangle&rdquo; a person is to choke them, or violently cut off their air supply, perhaps by squeezing on their neck.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hey, Sarge, <strong>cut it out</strong>! :: Quiet, Ed!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An excellent colloquial expression which means &ldquo;Stop it.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Doesn&rsquo;t it <strong>strike</strong> anyone as <strong>curious</strong> that Malvole was one of the two men lost in action?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something &ldquo;strikes a person as curious,&rdquo; they think of it as strange.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Raymond Shaw, his life, his background, his habits and his friends and <strong>associates</strong> have been under <strong>scrupulous</strong> examination.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A person&rsquo;s &ldquo;associates&rdquo; are the people that they interact with in everyday life, often at work. If an examination is &ldquo;scrupulous,&rdquo; it is done extremely carefully and looks into every detail.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The facts speak for themselves.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of saying that what is happening is totally clear or obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s <strong>inconceivable</strong> that&hellip; :: Major, as the consulting <strong>psychiatrist</strong>, I&rsquo;d be most interested in hearing your personal feelings about Shaw.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something is &ldquo;inconceivable,&rdquo; it does not seem possible. A &ldquo;psychiatrist&rdquo; is a psychologist who is also a medical doctor (and a &ldquo;consulting&rdquo; one is responsible for a particular person or case).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Raymond Shaw is the <strong>kindest</strong>, bravest, warmest most wonderful human being I&rsquo;ve ever known in my life.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Kind&rdquo; is another word for nice, gentle or considerate. (You'll be hearing this sentence several times during the movie.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;d recommend that the <strong>matter</strong> of Raymond Shaw be dropped and that Major Marco be reassigned to less <strong>strenuous</strong>, and if I may say so, less <strong>sensitive duties</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;matter&rdquo; is another word for case. &ldquo;Strenuous&rdquo; means exhausting or very tiring, and in this context, &ldquo;sensitive duties&rdquo; refers to jobs that involve secret matters of intelligence or national security.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A few months of <strong>detached</strong> service to perhaps <strong>the public relations corps</strong> should put the major right back <strong>in the pink</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Detached&rdquo; means separated, in this case from the army. &ldquo;The public relations corps&rdquo; of the military is responsible for keeping its good reputation with the public. If a person is &ldquo;in the pink,&rdquo; they have a lot of energy and feel very healthy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll give you an equally <strong>simple minded</strong> answer.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If an answer is &ldquo;simple minded,&rdquo; it is silly or not very thoughtful.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s no great naval power <strong>menacing</strong> the <strong>free world</strong> today.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To menace&rdquo; a person or country is to threaten it or make it feel weak or vulnerable. In the context of the Cold War, &ldquo;the free world&rdquo; referred to those countries in the non-communist West.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The navy&rsquo;s overwhelming <strong>preponderance</strong> of surface ships seems to be <strong>superfluous</strong>. Hence, the cut in budget.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Preponderance&rdquo; means superiority, usually in strength or intelligence. If something is &ldquo;superfluous,&rdquo; it is extra and not needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If there are no further questions for the secretary, I think that about <strong>wraps things up</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To wrap things up&rdquo; is a common colloquial way of saying to finish them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Evasion</strong>? What <strong>the hell</strong> are you talking about?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Evasion&rdquo; is the act of evading, avoiding or escaping a responsibility. Note that &ldquo;the hell&rdquo; is added to WH- questions to express emotion such as anger or frustration.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good public relations to talk that way to a United States Senator, even if he is an <strong>idiot</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An excellent word for a jerk, moron, ass or stupid person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I have a list here of the names of 207 persons who are known as being members of the Communist party.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that in the 1950s, many Americans were falsely accused of being members of the Communist Party, and even though political affiliation was not illegal, many peoples' lives were destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There will be no <strong>covering up</strong>, Sir.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To &ldquo;cover up&rdquo; something illegal or scandalous is to try and hide it from the public.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Major, throw that <strong>lunatic</strong> out of here!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A fun and excellent word for a person who is completely crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You no longer <strong>have my confidence</strong>! :: You&rsquo;re an idiot, you&rsquo;re <strong>out of your mind</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To have a person&rsquo;s confidence&rdquo; is to be trusted by them. If a person is &ldquo;out of their mind,&rdquo; they are crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What are you <strong>on</strong>?! Get out of here!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that to be &ldquo;on&rdquo; a drug is to be using it (If you are "on drugs", you will act stoned or in a drugged manner).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;d like to <strong>verify</strong> that number, Sir. How many communists did you say?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To verify&rdquo; a fact is to confirm or establish its truth or accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are 104 <strong>card-carrying</strong> communists in the defense department at this time.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is a &ldquo;card carrying&rdquo; member of an organization, they are full members who generally believe in that organization&rsquo;s principles.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The building or place where a group of soldiers is based.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He <strong>took out</strong> a complete <strong>company</strong> of Chinese <strong>infantry</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, &ldquo;to take out&rdquo; a group of soldiers is to kill them. A &ldquo;company&rdquo; in the military is a division, and &ldquo;infantry&rdquo; soldiers are those that fight on foot (as opposed to in planes or tanks).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We can <strong>spare</strong> an imaginary company of infantry for this particular plan.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To spare&rdquo; means to give up or use (Note that homeless people on city streets will ask if you can spare some change).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If we are out to <strong>humiliate</strong> our great Chinese <strong>ally</strong> in the newspapers of the world, we <strong>might as well</strong> make it a full <strong>battalion</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To humiliate&rdquo; a person is to embarrass them or make them feel bad about themselves. In a war, an &ldquo;ally&rdquo; is a nation that is fighting on its side against a common enemy. &ldquo;Might as well&rdquo; means should, and a &ldquo;battalion&rdquo; is a large division in the military.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If we may <strong>proceed</strong> with the demonstration; Who&rsquo;s that little <strong>fellow</strong> sitting next to the captain?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To proceed&rdquo; with something is to start or continue it. &ldquo;Fellow&rdquo; is another word for man or guy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our <strong>mascot</strong>, I guess you&rsquo;d call him.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A person, animal or object that becomes the public symbol of a team, business or other type of organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Shoot Bobby through the <strong>forehead</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The part of the head above the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What makes it so <strong>awful</strong> is to keep dreaming a thing like that about Sergeant Shaw.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A powerful word meaning terrible or horrible.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I think I&rsquo;m <strong>going nuts</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A common colloquial expression meaning to go crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The dream has a lot of Chinese people, and a lot of big <strong>brass</strong> from the Russian army.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Brass&rdquo; is a word that refers to important or powerful people. It comes from the many gold medals that military leaders wear.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s pretty <strong>rough</strong>; You have to <strong>take my word</strong> for that.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;rough&rdquo; means hard or difficult. &ldquo;To take a person&rsquo;s word&rdquo; for what they just said means to believe them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Raymond, why don&rsquo;t you pass the time by playing a little <strong>solitaire</strong>.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;sanitarium&rdquo; is a rest home for old people. In this context, a &ldquo;check up&rdquo; is a medical or psychological examination.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He was <strong>run down</strong> in the street by a <strong>hit and run</strong> driver.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;run down,&rdquo; they are hit or run over by a car. A &ldquo;hit and run&rdquo; driver is one who does not stop, but who drives away immediately from the scene of an accident.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It just came over the <strong>AP</strong>; <strong>Good heavens</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;AP&rdquo; is the Associated Press, which distributes news over their wire service. &ldquo;Good heavens&rdquo; is a gentle way of expressing surprise or shock.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We will not tell him on the chance there is some sort of prearranged <strong>code</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;code&rdquo; is a system of letters, numbers or other symbols that are used to communicate to some people while being unreadable to all others.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I was flown in last night under embassy <strong>quota</strong>. <strong>Revolting</strong> journey.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;quota&rdquo; is a number of spaces or slots that are reserved for a particular group of people. If something is &ldquo;revolting,&rdquo; it is totally disgusting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re going through this <strong>elaborate procedure</strong> simply <strong>out of precaution</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;elaborate procedure&rdquo; is a complicated and well thought out plan or scheme, and if it&rsquo;s done &ldquo;out of precaution,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s done as a way of preventing what could be a possible threat or danger.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s one of the few <strong>Soviet operations</strong> in America that actually showed a profit at the end of the <strong>fiscal year</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Soviet&rdquo; refers to the former Soviet Union, the communist state centered on Russia that fell apart at the end of the Cold war. In this case, &ldquo;operations&rdquo; refers to an office or business. &ldquo;Fiscal year&rdquo; is a term from accounting that refers to the business year.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Beware</strong> my dear Zilkov. The fires of capitalism are highly <strong>infectious</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Beware&rdquo; is a dramatic way of telling a person to be careful because there is danger near. If a disease is &ldquo;infectious,&rdquo; it can be easily passed from one person to another.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You should try, comrade Zilkov, to <strong>cultivate</strong> a sense of humor.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To cultivate&rdquo; something is to grow or nurture it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Captain Marco sent up some low <strong>flares</strong>, so it was easy to see what was happening.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>The enemy had a <strong>fix on the position</strong>. They were killed instantly by a <strong>high mortar shell</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, to have a &ldquo;fix on a soldier&rsquo;s position,&rdquo; is know where they are located. A &ldquo;high mortar shell&rdquo; is a powerful explosive used in war.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do you realize, comrade, the <strong>implications</strong> of the weapon that has been placed <strong>at your disposal</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The implications&rdquo; of something are the logical result or outcome (If A is larger than B, and B is larger than C, the implication is A is larger than C). If a weapon is &ldquo;at a person&rsquo;s disposal,&rdquo; it is available for their use.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Having been <strong>relieved</strong> of those uniquely American symptoms, guilt and fear, he cannot possibly <strong>give himself away</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;relieved&rdquo; of an unpleasant symptom, they no longer suffer from it. If a person who has done something illegal &ldquo;gives themselves away,&rdquo; they accidentally do something that the police or others realize shows that they did that illegal action.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Raymond will remain an <strong>outwardly normal</strong>, productive, <strong>sober</strong>, and a respected member of the community.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;outwardly normal,&rdquo; there is nothing about them which appears strange to others. A person who is &ldquo;sober&rdquo; is calm, stable and in control of themselves, as opposed to drunk.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And entirely <strong>police-proof</strong>. His brain has not only been washed, as they say, it&rsquo;s been <strong>dry cleaned</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, if a plan is &ldquo;police-proof,&rdquo; the police won&rsquo;t be able to find out about it. &ldquo;Dry cleaned&rdquo; clothes are washed with chemicals, not water.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Sealed</strong> floors or no, you will permit him to have visitors.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a floor is &ldquo;sealed,&rdquo; it is tightly closed off from the rest of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It will take about a week&hellip;to check the <strong>mechanism</strong> completely.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; refers to the small parts of a machine, or how the various parts of a machine or plan fit together to work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ll want to be sure the <strong>linkages</strong> are still functioning correctly.</em></p>

  <li>&ldquo;Linkages&rdquo; are the parts of a machine or plan that connect two or more separate parts together.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I thought to spend my afternoon at <strong>Macy&rsquo;s</strong>. Madame Yin has given me the most <strong>appalling</strong> list.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m shocked you would risk an <strong>asset</strong> as valuable as Raymond out of <strong>sheer</strong> nervousness.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;asset&rdquo; is anything of real value, from stock in a company to a house or car. &ldquo;Sheer&rdquo; as an adjective means total, pure, utter or unqualified.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If kill we must, for a better New York, why should it not be his <strong>superior</strong> at the newspaper, Mr. Holborn Gaines?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;superior&rdquo; is their boss or employer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>With Mr. Gaines <strong>out of the way</strong>, might he not be given the very <strong>influential</strong> job himself?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If somebody is &ldquo;out of the way,&rdquo; they are far enough away that they can&rsquo;t cause problems. If a writer is &ldquo;influential,&rdquo; they effect the way people think about things (An influential job simply means a powerful position).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m sorry to <strong>disturb</strong> you, Sir.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To disturb&rdquo; a person is to bother or annoy them, or in certain contexts, to emotionally upset or scare them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What <strong>the devil</strong> are you doing here at 4:00 in the morning?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A very old-fashioned version of &ldquo;the hell,&rdquo; which is added to Wh- questions to express emotion such as anger or surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re not going to <strong>pour out your heart</strong> with the details of some <strong>sordid</strong> love affair or anything like that, are you?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To pour out your heart&rdquo; is to confide in someone by emotionally telling them of all your tragic secrets, often concerning a failed romance. &ldquo;Sordid&rdquo; is a fun little adjective which means dirty, filthy or vile, and is often used in sexual contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Who is this mysterious &ldquo;they&rdquo;?</em></p>
<ul>

<ul>
  <li>Whisky from Scotland.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I got a guy who <strong>picks them out</strong> for me <strong>at random</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>He ships them to me. Where I happen to be <strong>stationed</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a solider is &ldquo;stationed&rdquo; at a place, that is where he lives and works.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They&rsquo;d also make great <strong>insulation</strong> against an enemy attack.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;insulation&rdquo; is a layer of protection (In houses, insulation is any kind of material that is used to keep a house warmer or cooler).</li>

<ul>
  <li>Note that a &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; can be a powerful officer who heads an entire department or branch of government (In this case, the Secretary of the Navy). An &ldquo;unfortunate remark&rdquo; is a gentle way of referring to a harmful statement that never should have been said. A &ldquo;rampage&rdquo; is a violent, angry and often abusive speech or other type of action.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For the last six months, I&rsquo;ve been driven nearly <strong>out of my mind</strong> by the same <strong>recurring</strong> dream.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;out of their mind,&rdquo; they are crazy, and if a dream is &ldquo;recurring,&rdquo; it happens over and over again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s something <strong>phony</strong> about me, about Raymond Shaw, about the whole medal of honor business.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Phony&rdquo; means misleading or fake. If a person is phony, they are pretending to be somebody that they are not.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In fact, he&rsquo;s one of the most <strong>repulsive</strong> human beings I&rsquo;ve ever known.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An extremely negative adjective that means totally disgusting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Public relations has <strong>bounced</strong> you back to me, and in your present <strong>state</strong>, there&rsquo;s no possible way I can use you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To bounce&rdquo; a worker from one job to another is to move them between position (A ball bounces against a wall).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As of this moment, I&rsquo;m placing you on <strong>indefinite sick leave</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a period of time is &ldquo;indefinite,&rdquo; it is unclear or has no exact limits. &ldquo;Sick leave&rdquo; is a paid break from work in which an employee is allowed to stay home and try to recover or feel better.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Maryland</strong> is a beautiful state. :: This is <strong>Delaware</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>We certainly are in <strong>good spirits</strong> tonight, aren&rsquo;t we?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;in good spirits,&rdquo; they are happy and feel good.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A nice long <strong>chat</strong> about the good old days in Korea and some old Russian and Chinese friends of ours.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;chat&rdquo; is a casual or informal conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I used to be convinced that as a baby, I was the <strong>sole</strong> survivor of a ship that <strong>overshot</strong> Mars.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>As an adjective, &ldquo;sole&rdquo; means only or single. &ldquo;To overshoot&rdquo; a destination is to go so fast that you travel past without being able to stop in time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Aren&rsquo;t you going to <strong>pop champagne</strong> or at least kiss the bride?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>A small and smelly type of fish that some people love and most hate.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Bustle</strong>! <strong>Make like</strong> a housewife. I&rsquo;ll get out of this idiot <strong>suit</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To bustle&rdquo; is to act in a very busy manner, doing lots of things quickly. &ldquo;Make like&rdquo; a housewife is a slangy way of telling a person to act like a housewife, and a &ldquo;suit&rdquo; is a formal set of pants and jacket (Note that idiot can be used as an adjective).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The reason I came here this morning is to ask Raymond to voluntarily put himself <strong>under arrest</strong>. To surrender himself to some questioning.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be put &ldquo;under arrest&rdquo; is to be held at a police station because of suspicion that a crime has been committed (Usually, the police arrest the suspect, rather than the suspect putting themselves under arrest!).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s the healthiest man I&rsquo;ve seen in my whole life. You can tell that just by looking at him. :: That&rsquo;s not the kind of <strong>sick</strong> I mean.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that if a person is &ldquo;sick,&rdquo; it can be either physical or psychological.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s <strong>tied up inside in 1,000 knots</strong>, but you can see for yourself how he is with me.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;tied up inside in 1,000 knots,&rdquo; they are suffering great psychological or emotional stress and are not sure what to do about it. (A &ldquo;knot&rdquo; is a sting, rope or other things tied together in a small ball, or more generally, a big problem).</li>

<p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re already <strong>wired</strong> for a room.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, if a room is &ldquo;wired,&rdquo; it has been fitted with small electronic devices that can listen in on what is being said.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Have you noticed how the human race is <strong>divided</strong> into two distinct and <strong>irreconcilable</strong> groups.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If two groups are &ldquo;distinct,&rdquo; they are quite different from each other and usually easy to tell apart. If two people have differences in opinion that are &ldquo;irreconcilable,&rdquo; they will not be able to come to a solution or agreement, or more generally, repair their relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It appears though that the Montague-Capulet note will have little effect on the <strong>feud</strong> now <strong>raging</strong> between the party leaders.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;feud&rdquo; between two people is a bitter or angry war of words or general hostility. If a feud &ldquo;rages,&rdquo; it continues with loud or uncontrolled anger (The Montagues and Capulets were feuding families in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I now <strong>charge</strong> this man, Thomas Jordan, with <strong>high treason</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To charge&rdquo; a person is to officially accuse them of having committed a crime. &ldquo;High treason&rdquo; is the serious offense of having worked for the enemy, against the interests of your own country.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I <strong>assure</strong> you, the moment the Senate <strong>reconvenes</strong>, I shall move for this man&rsquo;s <strong>impeachment</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To assure&rdquo; a person of something is to promise them you will do it, or to make them feel secure in what is being said. When a meeting &ldquo;reconvenes,&rdquo; it starts up again after having stopped for a break. &ldquo;Impeachment&rdquo; is the act of removing a person from their office or position of power, for having done something illegal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Convey</strong> my personal apologies; I&rsquo;ll join you there later.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To convey&rdquo; is to communicate or signal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to <strong>beat</strong> this <strong>vile</strong>, <strong>slandering</strong> son of a <strong>numbskull</strong> to a bloody <strong>pulp</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To beat&rdquo; a person is to physically attack them. &ldquo;Vile&rdquo; is disgusting or repulsive, and &ldquo;to slander&rdquo; a person is to say untrue things about them which will harm their reputation. A &ldquo;numbskull&rdquo; is a dated but fun word for a dumb person and &ldquo;pulp&rdquo; is tiny little bits of soft fruit, or more generally, anything that&rsquo;s been crushed into tiny little pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Something very important has <strong>come up</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a problem &ldquo;comes up,&rdquo; it suddenly appears or arrives.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>She <strong>turned in</strong> about a quarter to three.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, &ldquo;to turn in&rdquo; is to go to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll force some good whiskey on you, celebrate your wedding, <strong>soothe</strong> you after a trying day.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To soothe&rdquo; a person is to relieve, clam them down or make them feel relaxed. If a day is &ldquo;trying,&rdquo; it has been difficult and tiring.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I only hope you haven&rsquo;t been too <strong>upset</strong> by these <strong>idiotic</strong> attacks of Iselin.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Upset&rdquo; is emotionally disturbed, angry or worried. If something is &ldquo;idiotic,&rdquo; it is completely ridiculous, stupid or foolish.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I take the <strong>position</strong> that any attack by Iselin is a great honor.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that &ldquo;position&rdquo; can mean opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What the hell is that in your hand? :: It&rsquo;s a <strong>pistol</strong>, Sir.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A common word for small gun.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Is that a <strong>silencer</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A device on a gun that allows it to shoot without making any noise.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My wife is <strong>prostrate</strong> over the loss of this dear and wonderful girl she loved as a daughter.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Madison Square Garden&rdquo; is a famous convention center in New York.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>What do you know</strong>! They just handed the Vice President nomination to that idiot Iselin!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you know!&rdquo; (<em>not</em> in the tone of a question) is a way of expressing great surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The <strong>patrol</strong> was taken by a Russian <strong>airborne unit</strong> and flown by helicopter across the Manchurian border.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;patrol&rdquo; is a group of soldiers, and an &ldquo;airborne unit&rdquo; is a military division that travels and fights with airplanes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We were worked on for three days by a team of specialists from the <strong>Pavlov Institute</strong> in Moscow.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;Pavlov Institute&rdquo; is a medical research organization (Pavlov was a 19<sup>th</sup> century Russian scientist who was famous for training or conditioning rats and other animals to behave in certain ways).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They developed a <strong>technique</strong> for <strong>descent</strong> into the <strong>unconscious mind</strong>, part light <strong>induced</strong> and part drug.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;technique&rdquo; is a method or process. &ldquo;Descent&rdquo; is the act of going down, and the &ldquo;unconscious mind&rdquo; is the part of a person&rsquo;s thought process or thinking that they are not aware of. If something is &ldquo;induced&rdquo; by light, it is caused or triggered by light.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We were <strong>drilled</strong> for three days.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a prisoner is &ldquo;drilled,&rdquo; they are aggressively questioned, or in this case, aggressively brainwashed!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I <strong>strangled</strong> Ed Marole and shot Bobby Lemeck.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To strangle&rdquo; a person is kill them by violently cutting off their air supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They picked me to see if my <strong>linkages</strong> still worked before they turned me over to my <strong>American operator</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;linkage&rdquo; is a connection, or in this case, the mental connections in the brain that cause a deep hypnotic state. Raymond&rsquo;s &ldquo;American operator&rdquo; is the American responsible for controlling him and telling him what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Something somebody said in the bar accidentally <strong>triggered</strong> it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To trigger&rdquo; an event is to cause it or set it off.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Their beautifully conditioned links are over; They&rsquo;re <strong>smashed</strong> as of now because we say they are to be <strong>smashed</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something has been &ldquo;smashed,&rdquo; it has been crushed or destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re <strong>busting up</strong> the <strong>joint</strong>, we&rsquo;re <strong>tearing up</strong> all the wire.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To bust up&rdquo; something is to destroy it or turn it into a mess. A &ldquo;joint&rdquo; is a slangy word for a small building or room. &ldquo;To tear up&rdquo; wire is to rip or pull it out so that it is made useless.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anybody invites you to a game of solitaire, you tell them &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry <strong>Buster</strong>, the game is over.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Buster&rdquo; is a very slangy way of addressing a person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The <strong>convention</strong> is <strong>adjourned</strong>. It <strong>reconvenes</strong> at 9:00 for the <strong>acceptance speeches</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;convention&rdquo; is a large gathering of people, often for a political purpose. If a meeting is &ldquo;adjourned,&rdquo; it stops, and if it &ldquo;reconvenes,&rdquo; it starts up again later. At a political convention, &ldquo;acceptance speeches&rdquo; are made to accept the nominations of a party to run for an office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve got 500 people <strong>at my disposal</strong>, 1,000 if needed.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have something &ldquo;at your disposal,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s available to use.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s been decided that you&rsquo;ll be dressed as a priest to help you <strong>get away</strong> in the <strong>pandemonium</strong> afterward.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, to &ldquo;get away&rdquo; is to escape. &ldquo;Pandemonium&rdquo; is an excellent word for general chaos and violent, loud disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Chunjin will give you a two piece Soviet <strong>sniper&rsquo;s</strong> rifle that fit&rsquo;s nicely into a special bag.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;sniper&rdquo; is a person who shoots at people from a hidden place.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a spotlight booth that won&rsquo;t be in use.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;spotlight&rdquo; is a very bright and powerful light that can be seen from far away. A &ldquo;booth&rdquo; is a stand or stall for selling goods at a convention.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You are to shoot the Presidential <strong>nominee</strong> through the head, and Johnny will rise <strong>gallantly</strong> to his feet.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;nominee&rdquo; of a political party is the person chosen by that party to run for a particular office (in this case, President). To rise &ldquo;gallantly&rdquo; is to stand with great confidence and power, like a king.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The speech is short, but it&rsquo;s the most <strong>rousing</strong> speech I&rsquo;ve ever read. It&rsquo;s been worked on here and in Russia for over eight years.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a speech is &ldquo;rousing,&rdquo; it causes great emotion or excitement among the people who hear it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Rallying</strong> a nation of television viewers into <strong>hysteria</strong>, to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make <strong>martial law</strong> seem like <strong>anarchy</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To rally&rdquo; people is to get them excited about a particular cause or event. &ldquo;Hysteria&rdquo; is uncontrolled emotion or excitement. &ldquo;Martial law&rdquo; is strict rule by the military, and &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; is the lack of law or government, or a more general word for chaos or disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;he finishes the <strong>phrase</strong> &ldquo;Nor would I ask any American to give something in defense of his freedom that I would not gladly give myself.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; is an expression or set of words.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I know you will never entirely <strong>comprehend</strong> this Raymond, but you must believe I did not know it would be you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To comprehend&rdquo; is to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I am <strong>on the point of</strong> winning them the greatest <strong>foothold</strong> they&rsquo;ll ever have in this country and they paid me back by taking your <strong>soul</strong> away from you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be &ldquo;on the point of&rdquo; doing something is to be about to do it (Today, it&rsquo;s much more common to say on the <em>verge</em> of doing something). A &ldquo;foothold&rdquo; is a starting position that can be used as a base for later advance or expansion. A person&rsquo;s &ldquo;soul&rdquo; is the non-physical part of who they are, which according to religions, lives on after one dies.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I told them to build me an <strong>arsenal</strong> and they chose you, because they thought it would <strong>bind</strong> me closer to them.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;arsenal&rdquo; is a plant for the building and storage of weapons. &ldquo;To bind&rdquo; one person to another is to hold or stick them close together.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And when I take power, they will be pulled down and <strong>ground</strong> into dirt for what they did to you, and what they did in so <strong>contemptuously</strong> <strong>underestimating</strong> me.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To ground&rdquo; a person into dirt is to crush them into little pieces. If a person acts &ldquo;contemptuously,&rdquo; they behave in a snobby way, looking down on the person they are dealing with. &ldquo;To underestimate&rdquo; a person is to believe they are not as smart, talented, strong, etc. as they really are.</li>

<p><em>It was a <strong>calculated risk</strong>; You were right to take it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;calculated risk&rdquo; is an action that involves danger, but that is done only after intelligently thinking about how much risk is really involved.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If Stieman doesn&rsquo;t take off that stupid hat and stop <strong>messing around</strong> with those <strong>broads</strong>, I&rsquo;m gonna <strong>bust</strong> him into a <strong>PFC</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To mess around&rdquo; with someone is to joke around with them or to pass time with them in a not very serious manner. &ldquo;Broad&rdquo; is a ridiculously dated slang word for a woman. In this case, &ldquo;to bust&rdquo; a person in the military means to demote them to a lower rank. A "PFC" is a Private First Class, one of the lowest ranks in the Army.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ok, Milt, I <strong>blew it</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To blow it&rdquo; is an excellent expression which means to do something very badly, or even to forget entirely to do something that needed to be done.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the <strong>Pentagon</strong> ever wants to open up a stupidity division, they know who they can get to lead it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The Pentagon&rdquo; is the five sided building in Washington that houses the US military, and more generally, the US military command itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s what I <strong>figured</strong>. Let me get <strong>the hell</strong> out of here.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To figure&rdquo; is a common way of saying to think or believe. &ldquo;The hell&rdquo; is a filler added to express emotion such as frustration.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you got a <strong>tip</strong> there was bomb planted here, you&rsquo;d stop it fast enough.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A "tip" is an important and often secretly given piece of information that helps a person solve a problem, or in this case, avoid something bad.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I tell you there&rsquo;s a bomb just waiting to go off.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a bomb &ldquo;goes off,&rdquo; it explodes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ladies and gentleman, our national anthem.</em></p>

  <li>The official song of a country (In the US, it is &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stop <strong>twitching</strong>; Raymond&rsquo;s never missed with a <strong>rifle</strong> in his life.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To twitch&rdquo; is to move one&rsquo;s muscles about nervously or in sudden jerking motions. A &ldquo;rifle&rdquo; is a gun with a long barrel through which the bullets pass.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Were <strong>in like flint</strong>, lover.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An old-fashioned expression which means to have succeeded at something difficult so that you are now in a good situation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s with <strong>humility</strong>, <strong>albeit</strong> <strong>enormous</strong> <strong>pride</strong>, that I must humbly and gratefully accept this nomination for the highest office in our land.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Humility&rdquo; is a feeling of being humble, or almost of not feeling like you truly deserve what you&rsquo;ve been given. &ldquo;Albeit&rdquo; is a very formal word for "although" or "even though". &ldquo;Enormous&rdquo; means huge or extremely big and &ldquo;pride&rdquo; is the feeling of being highly pleased with oneself.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The years of decision, and if I may be permitted a <strong>phrase</strong> of my own, the years of striving.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; is a brief expression, and &ldquo;to strive&rdquo; means to work hard for something or toward a much desired goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You should read some of the <strong>citations</strong> sometime.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Here, &ldquo;citations&rdquo; are official expressions of appreciation and gratefulness.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Killing four enemies in the process when one arm and one leg was <strong>shattered</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person&rsquo;s leg has been &ldquo;shattered,&rdquo; it has been blown into pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He could only <strong>crawl</strong> because the other leg had been blown off.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To crawl&rdquo; is to move on your hands and knees, like a baby.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He pulled two of his men to safety <strong>amid</strong> 69 dead and 203 <strong>casualties</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Amid&rdquo; means surrounded by or in the middle of. A &ldquo;casualty&rdquo; is a person who has been killed or seriously wounded, often during a war.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Made to commit acts too <strong>unspeakable</strong> to be <strong>cited</strong> here, by an enemy who had captured his mind and soul.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If an act is &ldquo;unspeakable,&rdquo; it is so horrible or disgusting that people don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Here, &ldquo;cited&rdquo; means officially listed or mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He heroically and <strong>unhesitatingly</strong> gave his life to save his country.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is a rare adverb which means to do something without hesitation, doubt or delay.</li>

  <p>2. Was Raymond the only brainwashed American? Is it possible Major Marco was too?</p>

  <p>4. How is fear portrayed in this movie? Who is afraid? Are their fears justified? Are they paranoid?</p>
  <p>5. Why do you think this movie was remade in 2004?</p>
