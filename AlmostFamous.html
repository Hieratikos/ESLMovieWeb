  <p><p>
    This film is the story of a sweet and very smart kid who loves rock music,
    and whose dream is to be a rock music writer. Most of the film takes place in 1973,
    when William Miller is 15, and when he sets out to write an article about an increasingly
    popular rock group called Stillwater. They are typical of the hard rock groups of that period,
    in that they are loud and seductive, but not nearly as good as the classic 1960s groups that
    came before them (such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones). Regardless, Stillwater is a
    fictional group, although they are very similar to such real 1970s bands as Bad Company or
    Grand Funk Railroad. And in fact, William himself is really Cameron Crowe in real life,
    the writer and director of this film, who began writing for Rolling Stone magazine in the
    early 1970s when he was just 15.
<p>
    While trying to get an interview with members of Stillwater, William meets several young
    female fans who travel around the country with the band. Most people would call them "groupies"
    because they sleep with the band members, but they like to think of themselves as "Band-Aids."
    One of these Band-Aids is Penny Lane (a nickname taken from the Beatles song), who is in love with
    Russell, Stillwater's lead guitarist. As William joins all of them on the road, he soon learns
    that rock stars are not always as "cool" as they seem to be, and that if girls like Penny are not
    careful, they can be easily hurt by the stars that they love.
<p>
  This is an excellent look at the "rock'n'roll scene" of the early 1970s, and as such, captures a
  time when the ideals and dreams of the 1960s had passed, and music was in the process of becoming a very big business.
<p>
    A note on <strong>Lester Bangs</strong> and <strong>Ben-Fong Torres</strong>: These two are in fact real people, and both were
    well known writers who were considered among the first important rock critics.

</p>
<p><em>Here's a <strong>theory</strong> for you to <strong>disregard</strong> completely...true music lives within you...with the <strong>vast scenic</strong> bridges and <strong>chorus</strong> in your brain.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A "theory" is an educated guess.</li>
<li>"To disregard" something is to ignore or reject it.</li>
<li>"Vast" means extremely big or huge, and if a view is "scenic," it is pretty or pleasing to the eye.</li>
<li>A "chorus" is a group of singers, often in a church.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It's a place apart from the vast <strong>benign</strong> lap of America.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If something is "benign," it is harmless.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The world's greatest <strong>rock'n'roll critic</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A "rock'n'roll critic" is a writer who reviews rock music, but since many people don't take any rock music seriously, some people think this term is a bit ridiculous.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Jim Morrison?! He's a drunken <strong>buffoon posing</strong> as a poet.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A "buffoon" is a ridiculously uneducated, stupid or moronic person.</li>
<li>"To pose" as a poet is to pretend that you are one, when in fact you have none of the real talent or ability that is needed (Jim Morrison was the lead singer of the group The Doors).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Iggy Pop! Put this on! This isn't on your <strong>playlist</strong>, is it?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A "playlist" is the list of songs that a disc jockey will play on their radio station.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I've been doing some <strong>stuff</strong> for a local <strong>underground</strong> paper.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Note that "stuff" is a very general word for things, and this case refers to pieces of writing.</li>
<li>Here, an "underground" paper is a slangy way of referring to a paper that has very few readers, and not one that is necessarily hiding from the government!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You'll meet them all again...on their long journey to the middle.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is Lester's way of saying that most rock stars (and critics) move to the middle of the road artistically, in order to try to get as popular as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Your writing is <strong>damn</strong> good.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A common and colloquial way of saying very.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rock'n'roll? It's over. You got here just in time for <strong>the death rattle</strong>. Last <strong>grasp</strong>. Last <strong>grope</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lester's way of saying that rock music has been so commercialized by big business that it's now dying.</li>
<li>The "death rattle" is the sound that a rattle snake or other animal makes just before it dies.</li>
<li>A "grasp" is a desperate attempt to reach (as in "a last grasp for air"), and a "grope" is to reach out blindly, or with no specific goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I used to do <strong>speed</strong>. I'd stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of <strong>dribble</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Speed" is an illegal drug that gives people lots of energy, but can make them a little crazy.</li>
<li>"Dribble" is the spit or saliva that comes out of a person's mouth when they're sleeping, but it also refers to bad writing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They're gonna be <strong>fake</strong> friends. They're gonna try to <strong>corrupt</strong> you.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Fake" is not real, and thus a "fake" friend is a person who is pretending to be your friend, but who really is just using you.</li>
<li>"To corrupt" a person is to try and lead them away from their own principles or values, often turning them into criminals.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Fucking</strong> nothing about you that is <strong>controversial, man</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Note the use of "fucking" as a totally empty filler word. Vulgar, but common among young people.</li>
<li>If something is "controversial," it causes much emotion, argument or disagreement.</li>
<li>The word "man" is often used as a filler word to express general emotion. Widely used among teenagers, but basically meaningless.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are people who want you to write <strong>sanctimonious</strong> stories about the genius of rock stars...</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A good word to describe something that is too serious or even religious or righteous in attitude.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>....and they'll <strong>ruin</strong> rock'n'roll and <strong>strangle</strong> everything we love about it, right?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>To "ruin" something is to kill or destroy it.</li>
<li>"To strangle" something is to choke it, or kill it by cutting off its air.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And then it just becomes an industry of cool.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is Lester's way of saying the rock music is being destroyed by record companies that are just trying to promote rock stars that look cool to young people,
  rather than those producing good music.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You're <strong>coming along</strong> at a very dangerous time for rock'n'roll.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, to "come along" means to arrive.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I can give you $35. Give me 1,000 words on Black Sabbath. :: An <strong>assignment</strong>?!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An "assignment" is a specific job, in this case to write an article.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You have to make your <strong>reputation</strong> on being honest and <strong>unmerciful</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A person's reputation is the general opinion that other people have of them. If a person is "unmerciful," they refuse to show mercy or kindness.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you <strong>get into a jam</strong>, you can call me.</em></p>

  <ul>
  <li>A "rumor" is a piece of news that many people hear, but it is unclear if it is really true.</li>
  <li>"To talk a person into" doing something is to try and convince or persuade them to do it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Bring him in and we'll <strong>send him out on a rail</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A dated way to say that they will tell him to leave, in an aggressive or rude manner (the "rail" is a railroad track, which trains travel on).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I believe in bands <strong>holding on to their roots</strong>; Those roots need to be <strong>augmented</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a band "holds on to its roots," it remembers where it came from, even after it gets super popular.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Hey man</strong>, I'd travel on a <strong>pogo stick</strong> if I though we could make more money.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Hey man" is an out-dated way of expressing general emotion at the beginning of a sentence.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><em>Do you know how to do a <strong>headlining tour</strong>? Do you know how to get a record not just <strong>pressed</strong>, but <strong>played</strong>?</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To headline" a concert tour is to be the last and most popular group to play each concert, after the less known groups have played.</li>
  <li>If a record is "pressed," it is made in the factory, and if it is played, the music on it is played on the radio.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><em>You're too sweet for rock'n'roll. :: Sweet?! Where do you <strong>get off</strong>?!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Another truly great phrasal verb: In this context, <em>asking</em> a person where or how they "get off" doing something is accusing them of having incredible nerve or disrespect, but if a person "gets off" doing something (in a positive sentence), he enjoys doing it very much.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><em>Just <strong>hang in there</strong>, and we'll <strong>get you out of</strong> this.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Hang in there" is a common way of telling a person to hold on or keep going, even if a situation is very difficult.</li>
  <li>"To get a person out of" something is to help them escape from it.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>If a place is "glamorous," it has great beauty, charm or elegance.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>A "hit and run" accident is when the driver of the car that hits another car or person immediately drives away in hopes that they will not be held responsible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>You <strong>slept with</strong> Jeff?! :: Yeah, but it <strong>didn't count</strong>. It was the summer we decided to be free of all rules.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>In this case, to "sleep with" a person is to have sex with them.</li>
  <li>If something "doesn't count," it is not important, or cannot be considered as either an accomplishment, or a violation of any rule.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>You <strong>act above</strong> us, you always have. You just <strong>held it over us</strong>, like you might leave.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To act above" others is to look down on them, or act in a snobby way.</li>
  <li>"To hold something over" other people is to use the threat of a possible action (in this case, the possibility that Russell may leave the group), in order to intimidate them or get what you want.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead. :: Don't be <strong>self-righteous</strong>, Russell.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A person who is "self-righteous" is one who acts as if they are always acting in a righteous or morally correct manner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>You're always talking about your fans. She was your biggest fan, and you threw her away.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>This is William's way of accusing Russell of mistreating Penny.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We're alive! We're going <strong>to make it</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>In this case, to "make it" means to survive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Sweet life! <strong>Hallelujah</strong>, dear God!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A very old religious word that basically means thank God!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Didn't anything happen after $600 of <strong>room service bills</strong>?</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>The money hotels charge for extra services, such as meals in the room, laundry services, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Ok, I think we should <strong>push up</strong> Flippo's Who cover.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>To "push up" a story is to publish it earlier than originally planned (Flippo is a Rolling Stoner writer, and The Who are a rock group).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Good, because it's going to take me three days to <strong>get through</strong> this research. It's all handwritten on little <strong>bits</strong> of paper.</em></p>

  </ul>
  <p><em>We are uncool. Women will always be a problem for guys like us, and most of the great art in the world is about that very problem.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>This is Lester's philosophical way of telling William that life is hard for guys who are not good looking and cool.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Good looking people, they got no <strong>spine</strong>. Their art never lasts.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A person's "spine" is their backbone, though here Lester is using it to mean courage or bravery.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Great art is about guilt and <strong>longing</strong> and love <strong>disguised</strong> as sex and sex disguised as love.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Longing" is a poetic word that means strong desire.</li>
  <li>If one thing is "disguised" as another, it is pretending to be that other.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Hey, you got <strong>a big head start</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>One way of saying a big advantage over other people.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>The only true <strong>currency</strong> in this <strong>bankrupt</strong> world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Currency" is money, and often refers to foreign money.</li>
  <li>If a person is "bankrupt," it means they have no money to pay their bills, but it also can refer to having no moral values. This may be Lester's poetic way of saying that people like him and William express honest emotional pain because they are "uncool" (though this word is never used).</li>
