  </div>
<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
    Forrest Gump is the story of an incredibly kind and gentle person who is
    also what some people might call "mildly retarded." It's true that he is
    not too smart, but he is very fortunate, because he has a mother and friend
    who love him dearly. Forrest is born and raised in rural Alabama, in the
    Southern United States. He grows up with his mother, who rents out rooms
    in the family house to people traveling through the area.
<p>
  Despite his lack of sophistication, and the fact that he was raised far from
  any major cities, Forrest manages to become personally involved in most of the
  critical events that take place in American History from the late 1950s until
  the early 1980s. This includes the Vietnam War, the Watergate Scandal, the Civil
  Rights and Anti-Vietnam War protest movements, and the Computer Revolution. Forrest
  even meets three American Presidents as well as Elvis Presley and John Lennon.
  In a way, this movie is a look at a period of American history through the eyes
  of a gentle soul who lacks cynicism, but simply accepts things for what they are.
<p>
    Ultimately, the story is about the relationships that Forrest develops through his life.
    We meet his mother, who will do anything for him, his two best friends from his
    days in the army, Bubba and Lieutenant Dan, and most importantly, Jenny, his true
    childhood sweetheart. Jenny experiences the changes in American culture from a
    totally different perspective than Forrest, eventually joining the various protest
    movements and subcultures of the 1960s and 70s. But in the end, she is faithful to
    her childhood friend, whose sincerity, kindness and loyalty she would find in no
    other person.
<p>
  A special note on language usage: Since much of the movie is narrated by Forrest,
  you should be careful to not internalize the ungrammatical aspects of his personal
  way of speaking. Aside from the obvious use of "double-negatives," Forrest also
  tends to conjugate the past tense of "to be" incorrectly, saying "we was" instead
  of "we were."

  <p><strong>New Words and Expressions:</strong></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em><strong>I'll bet</strong> you can walk all day in shoes like that and never feel anything.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A common way to say "I'm sure that..."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>His back is as <strong>crooked</strong> as a politician.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A good play on words: "Crooked" can mean marked by bends or curves, but it also means corrupt and dishonest.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>They were in the <strong>Ku Klux Klan</strong>. They dressed up like a bunch of ghosts or <strong>spooks</strong> or something.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>The "KKK" is an infamous group of violent racists that has existed in the United States since the 1860s. A "Spook" is a ghost.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>What are <strong>you all</strong> staring at?</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>In the Southern United States, "you all" operates as a form of "you," but note that it is always pronounced "ya'all."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>He has <strong>braces</strong> on his legs.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A clamp or brace that hold two or more pieces together.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Green Bough, Alabama</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>The County and State where Forrest grew up. States are divided into counties, though most people aren't particularly aware of them. Alabama is in the "deep South" of the United States.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Mama decided to <strong>let</strong> those rooms <strong>out</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A rather British way to say "rent out."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Your boy is different: His <strong>IQ</strong> is 75.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Intelligence Quotient," which is the standard test to measure a person's intelligence. An IQ of 100 is considered normal, which means that Forrest has an IQ which may be close to "retarded," or as some people say in the 1990's, "mentally challenged."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>He might be a bit on the slow side.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"He might be a little dumb."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>He's not going to a special school to <strong>retread</strong> tires!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "tread" is the outer covering of a tire, and thus to "retread a tire" is to put a new covering on the tire.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Your <strong>mama</strong> sure does care about your <strong>schooling.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Mama" is often used for mom, or mother, but outside of the South, it is usually used only by children.</li>
  <li>"Schooling" can be an alternative word for education.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Me and mama was on our own.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"We had to be responsible for ourselves, since no one else would take care of us."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>There were always <strong>folks</strong> coming and going.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Folks" is a very Southern way to say people. It can also mean parents.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Suitcases, hot cases, sample cases.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Different types of cases that Forrest discovers exist. A "sample case" may be a small box for jewelry or some other product for sale.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>He had him a guitar case.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Ungrammatical Southern English: Note the use of the object pronoun "him" after the verb "had." Avoid this grammatical construction, which is used quite a bit throughout the movie.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>That's not for children's eyes.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Mama's poetic way of saying "children are too young to see this."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>It must be hard being a king.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>A curious and somewhat old-fashioned expression meaning good, or well.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>"Stupid is as stupid does."</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An expression that became famous because of this movie. I think this is mama's way of saying "Just because you look stupid, you're not stupid unless you do stupid things."</li>

<ul>
<li>Forrest's way of saying "we went together well, and became best friends."</li>

  <p>A "fool" can be somebody who is considered dumb, or it can be someone who was made to look ridiculous in a particular situation.</p>
  <p><em>Her mama had <strong>gone to heaven</strong> when I was five.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Forrest's only way to say that somebody has died.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>You better get back here, girl.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>I put this here simply to tell you that "better" is the only word in English that functions as both an adverb ("I play better than you") and a auxiliary verb (as in the sentence above). Shocking, but true!</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Federal troops [are] enforcing a court order.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Reference to the incident in 1962, when President Kennedy ordered the US army to force the authorities of Alabama to allow two black students into the University of Alabama. A judge had ordered the admission of black students, and because of resistance in the South to such orders, the President had to use army soldiers to make sure that the order was obeyed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Coons, Niggers.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Very crude racist insults referring to blacks. "Coon" was short for the animal "raccoon."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>The Commander of the National Guard and Governor Wallace.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Wallace was the racist Governor of Alabama in 1962 who refused to obey the courts because he insisted the blacks must not be allowed to go to a State University with whites. The "National Guard" are soldiers under the command of individual Governors of the 50 states who are used in times of civil unrest (riots). However, in 1962, President Kennedy "nationalized" the guard so that the troops would follow his orders, and thus enforce the court order to allow blacks into the University.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>The University of Alabama had been <strong>desegregated.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Segregation" was the act of separating blacks and white.</li>
  <li>"To desegregate" is to end the legal separation that exists, in this case concerning schools.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Wasn't that Gump? :: Sure <strong>as hell</strong> was!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Another "hell" expression, used to add emotion to a sentence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>It was <strong>coed</strong><strong>.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Short for co-educational: An important word meaning that both males and females are present. It usually refers to a school.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>"He didn't know any better"</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A good way to excuse a stupid action!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Forrest, look at you! <strong>Come on!</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A wonderful and versatile phrasal verb, signifying everything from "Be serious" to "Please." Here, meaning "let's go!"</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p><em>I must have drunk me about 15 <strong>Dr. Peppers</strong>.</em></p>

  </ul>
  <p><em>I got to pee.</em></p>
  <ul>
