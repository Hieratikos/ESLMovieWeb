  </div>
<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
    This film is the story of the Burnhams, a typical American family that lives in
    an upper middle class suburb in the state of Connecticut, perhaps an hour or two
    outside of New York City.  Lester Burnham has a pretty wife and daughter, a nice
    house, and a fairly good paying career, but he is still extremely unhappy. He
    hates his job, he knows that both his wife and daughter have no respect for him,
    and he feels he is growing old way too fast.
<p>
  Carolyn Burnham is also unhappy, in part because she has a very hard time selling
  houses, and in part because her marriage is horrible and her daughter seems to hate
  her. Finally, Jane Burnham has her own unhappiness, both because she hates her parents,
  and more disturbingly, because her best friend and her father seem like they want to
  sleep with each other. In short, the Burnhams are the classic dysfunctional family.
<p>
  The Burnhams soon face great challenges when Lester decides to quit his job, Carolyn decides to
  have an affair with her greatest competition in the real estate business, and Jane falls in love
  with Ricky, the gentle yet somewhat strange young man who moves in next door. But the greatest
  crisis comes when Lester decides to recapture his youth by buying cars and drugs from his teen
  years, and by becoming obsessed with Angela, Jane's beautiful 16 year old friend. As Lester's
  life spins out of control, Jane, Carolyn and even Ricky's dad find their own reasons why it would
  be better if Lester were dead....

  <p><strong>New Words and Expressions:</strong></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>I need a father who is <strong>a role model</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "role model" is a person who others look up to as an example of excellent behavior or great accomplishment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Not some <strong>horny geek</strong> boy who is going to <strong>spray his shorts</strong> whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a person is "horny," they want to have sex.</li>
  <li>A "geek" is a socially awkward person, often more at ease with computers than people.</li>
  <li>Here, if a man "sprays his shorts," it's implied he is getting sexually excited (To spray is to scatter small drops of water, like a garden hose).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>What a <strong>lame-o</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Lame" is a slang word meaning stupid, bad or ridiculous (as well as injured or disabled). Children will sometimes add the suffix '-o' to an adjective like this to turn it into a noun (but this is rare for adults).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Someone should <strong>put him out of his misery</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To put a person out of their misery" is to kill them, perhaps because they are suffering so much that it's considered a humane thing to do.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Look at me; <strong>jerking off</strong> in the shower.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To jerk off" is the most common slang way of saying to masturbate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>This will be the <strong>high point</strong> of my day; <strong>It's all down hill from here</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"The high point" of a day or event is the most exciting or best part.</li>
  <li>If something goes "all down hill from here," it becomes worse, though note that in the right context, it could mean that it becomes easier!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>The handle on those <strong>pruning sheers</strong> matches her gardening <strong>clogs</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Pruning shears" are metal tools to cut (or prune) plants and bushes.</li>
  <li>"Clogs" are a type of shoe, usually made of wood on the bottom.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>How do you get them to <strong>flourish</strong> like this? Eggshells and <strong>Miracle-Grow.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a flower "flourishes," it grows with strength and beauty.</li>
  <li>"Miracle Grow" is a well-known fertilizer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Angry, <strong>insecure</strong>, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going <strong>to pass</strong>, but I don't want to lie to her.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A person who is "insecure" has little confidence in themselves, and is often nervous around other people.</li>
  <li>In this case, if a situation "passes," it goes away or dies out.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Nice going</strong> dad!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>This is usually a compliment, but Jane is being sarcastic and mocking.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Both my wife and daughter think I'm this <strong>gigantic loser</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Gigantic" is extremely big or huge.</li>
  <li>In this case, a "loser" is a person whose life in general is not happy, or who has little good about them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I didn't always feel this...<strong>sedated</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A person who is "sedated" is sleepy or not very alert, often because of the effects of a drug or depression.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We're all <strong>under a deadline</strong> here.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>To be "under a deadline" is to be in a situation where you have to finish something before a certain time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Product launch.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A business expression for the production, distribution and marketing (advertising) for any new product, from software to food.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I need to <strong>cut corners</strong> around here.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a company has to "cut corners," it has to reduce the money it spends.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Times are tight</strong> and you got <strong>to free up</strong> some cash.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>In this context, if "times are tight," there's little money left.</li>
  <li>"To free up" cash is to find savings in one area in order to spend it in another.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Like the time Mr. Flourney used the company <strong>MasterCard</strong> to pay for that <strong>hooker</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>MasterCard is a very well known brand of credit card.</li>
  <li>"Hooker" is a slang word for a prostitute.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>That's <strong>unsubstantiated gossip</strong>.</em></p>

  </ul>
  <p><em>That's because Greg has to pay women <strong>to fuck</strong> him.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To fuck" a person is a very crude way of saying to have sex with them (obviously!), but be aware that this word can be used in many grammatically different ways.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>A job description <strong>mapping out</strong> in detail how they contribute.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>To "map out" something is to clearly express in writing all of its important details and how they relate to each other.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Management can <strong>assess</strong> who's valuable and who is <strong>expendable</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To assess" a situation is to analyze or judge it carefully.</li>
  <li>If a person is "expendable," they are not really needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying <strong>to level with you</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To level with" a person is to speak with them very honestly, including, if necessary, by telling them unpleasant or bad news.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>You don't think it's <strong>weird</strong> and kind of <strong>fascist</strong>?</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Weird" is an important word that means strange or bizarre (It is widely used in this movie).</li>
  <li>"Fascist" usually refers to a dictatorial political system, but note many people use it more generally to refer to any system they think is unfair, such as how people are fired at a job.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Let's just all sell our <strong>souls</strong> and work for <strong>Satan</strong>, because it's more <strong>convenient</strong> that way!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A person's "soul" is the non-physical part of them that lives on after they die, and "Satan" is another name for the devil.</li>
  <li>If something is "convenient," it is accessible, easy to reach, or suited to one's needs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>That house would never have <strong>sat on the market</strong> for six months.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a house "sits on the market," it continues to be for sale, but nobody is willing to pay the price that is being asked.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Their <strong>Sycamore</strong>?! <strong>Come on</strong>!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "sycamore" is a type of tree.</li>
  <li>"Come on" is the most versatile phrasal verb in English. Here, it means "Stop saying nonsense and be serious."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>A <strong>substantial portion</strong> of the <strong>root structure</strong> was on our property!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "substantial portion" of something is a big part of it.</li>
  <li>The "root structure" of a tree refers to the part of the tree that grows out under the ground, in search of water and food.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I wouldn't <strong>have had the heart</strong> to cut down something if it wasn't partially mine.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a person doesn't "have the heart " to do something, they don't have the desire to do it, or they think it would be too cruel to do it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Do we always have to listen to this <strong>elevator music</strong>?</em></p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p><em>A nutritious but <strong>savory</strong> meal.</em></p>

  </ul>
  <p><em>I mean, <strong>hello</strong>, you've barely even spoken to me for months!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Note that in the right context and when said with a sarcastic or cynical tone of voice, this is a common way to imply that a person is being ridiculous, stupid, or insensitive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>What happened? We used to be <strong>pals</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A nice little word for friends.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>The ad said that this pool was <strong>lagoon-like</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A "lagoon" is a small lake, usually separated from the ocean by sand, and often found on tropical pacific islands. If the pool is lagoon-like," it looks like a lagoon.</li>

  <p><em>Yellow leaves from the <strong>maple trees</strong> that lined our street.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "maple tree" contains maple, which is the delicious syrup that Americans love to put on their breakfast pancakes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I guess I could be pretty <strong>pissed off</strong> about what happened to me, but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a person is "pissed off," they are very angry or upset. Very common.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to <strong>burst</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a balloon "bursts," it explodes because it has too much air or water.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>And then it <strong>flows through</strong> me like rain, and I can't feel anything but <strong>gratitude</strong>, for every single moment of my stupid little life.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>If a liquid "flows through" a body, it travels smoothly through it, perhaps like a river.</li>
  <li>"Gratitude" is an important word meaning appreciation or gratefulness.</li>

  <p>1. Are the Burnhams really a typical American family, or are they in fact more dysfunctional ("screwed up") than most? What about compared to your family?</p>
  <p>2. Why are Lester and Carolyn so unhappy? Should they be?</p>
  <p>3. Which characters had public images that hid who they really were, and which ones seemed to be completely honest?</p>
  <p>4. Do you think most men over 40 dream of being 18 again?</p>
  <p>5. What did you like and not like about this movie?</p>
