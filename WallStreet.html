  </div>
<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
  This movie is the story of a young and ambitious Wall Street stock broker named
  Bud Fox, who is determined to become rich like his hero, a stock trader and corporate
  raider named Gordon Gekko. Gekko is one of the richest, most ruthless and immoral
  businessmen in the country, who routinely uses inside (secret) corporate information
  to make deals, even though this is  completely illegal. He also buys companies cheap,
  only to destroy them and their workers’ jobs in order to sell off the company’s assets
  (such as planes, land, office buildings, etc). For Gekko, “greed is good.”
<p>
  After trying for several weeks, Bud gets to meet Gekko, and with a little luck, he is
  soon working with him, making investments with an account Gekko has set up for him.
  Gekko promises Bud lots of “perks” (benefits) if he does well with the money, and those
  benefits soon arrive. He also meets Darien at a party that Gekko is throwing, and now
  that he is starting to make so much money, he can afford to go out with her, despite her
  very expensive taste. Unfortunately, Bud soon learns the dark side of Gekko’s
  trading world, including his willingness to break any law, or for that matter, destroy
  any company to make more and more money. This includes the company where Bud’s
  father is the leader of the labor union, and for Bud, that is a bad deal that is just
  too close to home.
<p>
  This movie, which was made in 1987, does a good job of capturing the ambiance, and more
  specifically, the greed, that was a big part of the American scene during the 1980s. In
  fact, the character of Gordon Gekko is based loosely on a real corporate raider named
  Ivan Boesky, who was fined $100,000,000 and sentenced to several years in jail for his
  part in the insider trading scandals that shook Wall Street during that decade. Of course,
  wealth and money are relative; by the end of the 1990s, dozens of people in the US had
  accumulated fortunes in the billions of dollars, making the sums discussed in this movie
  seem almost insignificant!
<p>
  <strong><em>A Note on “Insider trading”</em></strong>: This is the act of trading stock after acquiring information
  from executives or other high officials inside a company. It is illegal, because it is
  believed the person who has this information has an unfair advantage over those who don’t.
  Of course, it is difficult to prove, and in the real world, many people often come very
  close to breaking this law.
  <p>
  <strong><em>The Three Most Important Companies in this Film (All Fictional):</em></strong><br/>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue Star Airlines:</strong>  The airline where Bud’s dad is a mechanic and union
  leader, which is facing bankruptcy because it cannot compete with bigger airlines. Bud feels
  he can save it, but Gekko has other ideas.</li>

  <li><strong>Teldar Paper:</strong> A huge paper company that Gekko wants to buy, forcing out
    all of their management. Obviously, the management tries to resist this.</li>

  <li><strong>Anacott Steel:</strong>  A steel company that Larry Wildman wants to buy and save,
  and in theory, make profitable for the long run. It becomes harder for Larry to do this when
  Gekko begins to buy stock in it, thus driving up the price.</li>

  <p></p>
<p><em>How are you doing? :: Doing any better, and it would be a <strong>sin</strong>.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lou&rsquo;s way of telling Buddy to leave the brokering business.</li>

<p><em>The country is <strong>going to hell</strong> faster than when that <strong>son of a bitch</strong> Roosevelt was in charge.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person or country is &ldquo;going to hell,&rdquo; it is becoming bad or weak.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;son of a bitch &ldquo; is a vulgar way to refer to a mean or abusive person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Putnam Drug. :: No, it will take five years for that company to <strong>come around</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, for a company to &ldquo;come around&rdquo; means to become strong and profitable again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stick to the fundamentals. That&rsquo;s how IBM and Hilton were built.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, a type of business advice that says companies should concentrate on doing what they do best (Building computers for IBM and running hotels for Hilton).</li>

  <li>A &ldquo;hot lead&rdquo; is a piece of information that could be very valuable.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Thrifts&rdquo; are a type of small lending bank (The research department is recommending to buy the stocks of certain thrift banks).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Dump them</strong>, <strong>for Christ&rsquo;s sake</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>"To dump" a stock is to sell it, often very quickly before it continues to go down in price. A very important verb in this film!</li>
  <li>"For Christ's sake" is a common way of expressing frustration or other emotion.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Jack, 30,000, 38 tops.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A short way of telling Jack to buy 38,000 shares of a particular stock, but to pay no more than $38 per share.</li>

<p>We are in the middle of the biggest <strong>bull market</strong> that our generation or any other has ever <strong>witnessed</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;bull market&rdquo; is a stock market in which prices are going up (A &ldquo;bear market&rdquo; is when prices are going down).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To witness&rdquo; something is to see or observe it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If I could have five minutes of your time to explore the <strong>extraordinary opportunities</strong> <strong>emerging</strong> in the international <strong>debt market</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An "extraordinary opportunity" is a very rare chance, in this case to make a lot of money.</li>
  <li>"To emerge" is to appear or become known.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;debt market&rdquo; is investments in corporate or government bonds (Debt is the money owed by one person or institution to another).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In 10 minutes <strong>it&rsquo;s history</strong>, at 4:00 I&rsquo;m a <strong>dinosaur</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Marv&rsquo;s way of saying that stocks must be sold extremely quickly, because their value changes dramatically in just a few seconds</li>
  <li>If something &ldquo;is history,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s old and useless, and &ldquo;dinasaurs&rdquo; are the huge monsters that ruled the earth millions of years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sure it&rsquo;s gone down, but you got the <strong>tip</strong>, I didn&rsquo;t.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;tip&rdquo; is a useful piece of information or advise.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Oh <strong>give me a break</strong>! How <strong>the hell</strong> was I supposed to know you were in surgery?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Give me a break&rdquo; is an excellent way of telling someone to stop saying nonsense, or to stop acting in a ridiculous way.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The hell&rdquo; is added to Wh- questions in order to show emotion such as frustration.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll discuss that with the <strong>account executive</strong> and get back to you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;account executive&rdquo; is a prestigious or fancy way of referring to a salesman, or in this case, stock broker.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You tell me that he&rsquo;ll <strong>DK</strong> you for a <strong>lousy</strong> 1/4 point?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Here, to &ldquo;DK&rdquo; a broker is to claim you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; them, so that you don&rsquo;t have to pay for a stock that has gone down in price since you bought it!</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Lousy&rdquo; is a good word for bad, or here, insignificant.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>$7,000 loss! You <strong>assigned</strong> me to this guy and you know he has a history of this kind of <strong>bullshit</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To assign&rdquo; a client to a broker is to give them that person&rsquo;s business.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; is a vulgar but excellent word for lies, nonsense, or in this case, unethical or immoral behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Howard the <strong>jerk</strong> <strong>reneged</strong> on me.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;jerk&rdquo; is a widely used word for an idiot, bastard, ass, etc&hellip;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To reneg&rdquo; on a person is to refuse to do what you had promised them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve got <strong>to cover his losses</strong> <strong>to the tune of</strong> about seven <strong>grand</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To cover a person&rsquo;s losses&rdquo; is to pay for them.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To the tune of&rdquo; is a way of saying &ldquo;that are equal to&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;grand&rsquo; is $1,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m <strong>tapped out</strong>, Marv. American Express has a <strong>hit man</strong> looking for me.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, if a person is &ldquo;tapped out,&rdquo; they no longer have any credit left with their credit card company (Here, American Express).</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;hit man&rdquo; is a person paid to kill somebody.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What do I got? A <strong>c-note</strong>? :: Thanks, Marv. <strong>I&rsquo;ll make it up to you</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;c-note&rdquo; is a $100 bill.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To make it up&rdquo; to somebody is to pay them back for a favor they have done.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>30 seconds after the <strong>Challenger</strong> blows up, Gekko&rsquo;s on the phone <strong>selling NASA stocks short</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; was the space craft the blew up in 1986, killing all the astronauts on board.</li>
  <li>To &ldquo;sell a stock short&rdquo; is to borrow stocks whose price is expected to decrease in the future. The trader sells the stocks right away, and when they decrease in value, he buys them on the open market for a reduced price, returns the stocks to the original owner, and makes a profit for doing nothing but guessing correctly.</li>
  <li>NASA is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the federal government.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And he had an <strong>ethical by-pass</strong> at birth.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A funny line. &ldquo;Ethical&rdquo; is another word for moral, and a &ldquo;by-pass&rdquo; is a serious heart operation. This is a way of saying that Gekko was born without morals or ethics, or that that were by-passed at birth.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If a person is "in a bind," they are in a difficult situation. If you are "edged out" by another person, you are being beaten by them (To "have an edge" at a skill is to be just a little more talented than the other).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Did he see you? :: Yeah, he <strong>saw right through me</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To see through&rdquo; a person is to see how they really are, and not how they want you to think they are.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Plenty of <strong>six-figure names</strong> in that <strong>zip code file</strong> to <strong>cold-call</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s going to be <strong>awesome</strong>. What do you say?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A wonderful adjective meaning excellent, fantastic, great, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Come on</strong>, forget <strong>charts</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Here, &ldquo;come on&rdquo; means &ldquo;be reasonable,&rdquo; but depending on the context, it can mean everything from hurry up to stop.</li>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;financial charts&rdquo; are sheets of paper with lots of graphs and other important information.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re not <strong>fund</strong> managers! <strong>Churn</strong> them and burn them!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;mutual fund&rdquo; is an investment which owns many separate company stocks, which helps individual investors diversify.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To churn&rdquo; something is to move it around violently, so this is Marv&rsquo;s way of saying he wants to buy and sell stocks quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lou Mannheim. Nice guy, <strong>swell</strong> <strong>fella</strong>, but he&rsquo;s a loser. He lost all his <strong>equity</strong> when the firm went <strong>belly up</strong> in the <strong>recession</strong> of &rsquo;71.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Swell&rdquo; is a somewhat dated adjective meaning nice or admirable, and a &ldquo;fella&rdquo; is a guy.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Equity&rdquo; is the value of real estate or stock that a person owns, and when a business firm goes &ldquo;belly up,&rdquo; it goes bankrupt and closes down.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;recession&rdquo; is a bad economic down turn.</li>

<p><em>I want you to buy 20,000 shares of Blue Star at 15 1/8<sup>th</sup>, <strong>3/8<sup>th</sup> tops</strong>, and don&rsquo;t <strong>screw it up</strong>, Sport. Think you can <strong>handle</strong> that?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;3/8<sup>th</sup> tops&rdquo; is Gekko&rsquo;s way of saying he won&rsquo;t pay more than 15 and 3/8<sup>th</sup> per share of Blue Star stock.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To screw up&rdquo; something is to do it badly.</li>
  <li>In this case, to be able to &ldquo;handle&rdquo; something is to be able to do it.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Telstar is <strong>shooting up</strong>. Did you buy any for yourself? :: No Sir, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been legal.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a company stock is &ldquo;shooting up,&rdquo; it is quickly rising in value. Note that Bud is still worried about using inside information.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Relax Pal, no one is going to <strong>blow the whistle</strong> on you.</em></p>

<p><em>Use a <strong>stop-loss</strong> so your <strong>down side</strong> is $100,000, and buy a <strong>decent</strong> suit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;stop-loss&rdquo; is a computer program that automatically sells a stock when it falls to a certain level.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;down side&rdquo; risk of an investment is the amount that could be lost.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;decent&rdquo; suit is socially acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And save the cheap salesmen talk, will ya? It&rsquo;s obvious.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A reference to the fact that Bud always appears like he is trying to sell something, even when he is pretending that he is not.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nothing <strong>ruins</strong> my day more than <strong>losses</strong>. Now you do good, and you get <strong>perks</strong>. Lots and lots of perks.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>"To ruin" something is to destroy it.</li>
  <li>In this case, "losses" refers to financial losses.</li>
  <li>"Perks" are additional benefits that employees get beyond their usual salary, such as a company car or vacations.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Maybe we could just <strong>drive around</strong> for a while. <strong>Work up an appetite</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To drive around&rdquo; is to drive with no particular pace to go.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>This guy who should know tells me to buy Hewlett Packard, but I&rsquo;ve been <strong>burned on tips</strong>.</em></p>

  <li>A &ldquo;balance sheet&rdquo; is a list of all the assets and debts that a company has.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We sure went <strong>down the toilet</strong> on that ugly bitch.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a stock goes down the toilet, it loses most of its value. This is Gekko&rsquo;s vulgar and silly way of referring to the Teldar stock.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Not bad for a <strong>city college</strong> boy.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A local school for adults, often called a community college.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I bought my way in, and now all those <strong>Ivy League</strong> <strong>schmucks</strong> are sucking my knee caps.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Ivy League&rdquo; schools are the best universities on the East coast, and include such famous institutions as Harvard and Yale (Ivy is a green plant that grows on the walls of many of these schools&rsquo; buildings).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Schmuck&rdquo; is an excellent Jewish word for a jerk, idiot, ass, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I just got on the <strong>board</strong> of the <strong>Bronx</strong> zoo. It cost me a <strong>mil</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;board&rdquo; of a corporation or other institution is the group that meets every few months to set general policies.</li>

  <li>A &ldquo;mil&rdquo; is a million dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The thing you got to remember about <strong>WASPs</strong>, they love animals and they <strong>can&rsquo;t stand</strong> people.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>WASPs are White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, or generally speaking, white Americans of Western European origin.</li>
  <li>If you "can't stand" something, you hate or detest it. Very common and useful.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The most valuable <strong>commodity</strong> I know of is information.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A commodity is a product of trade or commerce, especially basic materials like wood or rubber, or crops such as wheat.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The public is out there throwing darts at a board, Sport.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Darts&rdquo; are small sharp pointed objects that are thrown at boards as a game. This is Gekko&rsquo;s way of saying people don&rsquo;t know how to invest.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You wonder why fund managers can&rsquo;t beat the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The S&amp;P 500 refers to the 500 largest companies in the stock market.</li>
  <li>It is known that most mutual funds are not as good an investment as investing money in a mutual fund that invests in all the S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>These Harvard <strong>MBA</strong> types don&rsquo;t add up to dog shit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An MBA is a Masters in Business Administration. This is Gekko&rsquo;s way of saying even the most educated business people do not know how to invest well.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s <strong>trench warfare</strong> out there, pal.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is the type of horribly violent warfare in which armies face each other while shooting from trenches, which are long ditches dug in the ground. For Gekko, the buying and selling of companies is as bloody.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll <strong>go the extra mile</strong>. Just one more chance, Mr. Gekko.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To go the extra mile&rdquo; for a person is to do everything you absolutely can to help them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You want another chance? :: <strong>Fucking A</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A rather strange and certainly vulgar expression which means Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Like all <strong>Brits</strong>, he thinks he was born with a better pot <strong>to piss</strong> in.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;Brit&rdquo; is a British person, and &ldquo;to piss&rdquo; is to urinate or go to the bathroom. Gekko thinks British people are snobby or arrogant.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He <strong>bribed</strong> an old secretary of mine to open her mouth and stole RDR Pharmaceuticals <strong>right from under me</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Payback time, Sport.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A colloquial way of saying that it is time to get revenge on somebody who has done something bad to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anyway, I had a <strong>mole</strong> in Wildman&rsquo;s <strong>operation</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, a &ldquo;mole&rdquo; is a spy, and Wildman&rsquo;s &ldquo;operation&rdquo; is his business offices, where business deals are decided on.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Wildman is in town. <strong>Something big is going down</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A very slangy way of saying something important is going to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the <strong>SEC</strong> found out, I could go to jail. That&rsquo;s <strong>inside information</strong>, isn&rsquo;t it?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The SEC is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the sale of stocks.</li>
  <li>"Inside information" is a key legal term which refers to information that is not allowed to be passed on by company executives or employees to others, since it could effect stock prices.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unless your father is on the <strong>board of directors</strong> of another company, you and I are going to have a very <strong>tough time</strong> doing business together.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The "Board of Directors" of a company sets general policies for that company. If you have a "tough time" doing something, it is hard to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not talking about some $400,000 a year <strong>working</strong> Wall Street <strong>stiff</strong> flying first class.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;working stiff&rdquo; is a slang term for a middle class guy who works hard to survive. For Gekko, $400,000 a year (in 1985!) was a small salary!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m talking about <strong>liquid</strong>. Rich enough to have your own jet. $100,000,000 dollars. A <strong>player</strong>&hellip;or nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, if a person is "liquid," they have so much money they can effect the future of entire companies.</li>
  <li>"A player" is that wealthy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You <strong>had what it took</strong> to get into my office; The question is if you <strong>have what it takes</strong> to stay there.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s <strong>trade deficit</strong> and <strong>fiscal deficit</strong> are at nightmare <strong>proportions</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;trade deficit&rdquo; is the (negative) difference between what a country sells and buys, and a &ldquo;fiscal deficit&rdquo; is the (negative) difference between what a country gets in taxes and what it spends.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Proportion&rdquo; is the relationship between a part (the deficit) and the whole (total income).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There was <strong>accountability</strong> to the stockholder.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Another way of saying responsibility, or necessity to explain.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Mellons, the Carnegies, the people who built this great industrial power, made sure of it because it was their money at stake.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gekko&rsquo;s way of saying that people like Andrew Carnegie were more determined than today&rsquo;s management to make US companies successful, since they owned such a high percentage of them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You, the stockholders, are all being royally <strong>screwed over</strong> by these&hellip;. <strong>bureaucrats</strong>, with their steak lunches, their hunting and fishing trips.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is being &ldquo;screwed over,&rdquo; they are being cheated or treated very poorly (&ldquo;Royally&rdquo; in this case means extremely, though as an adjective it generally refers to a King or Queen).</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;bureaucrat&rdquo; is a negative way of referring to a person who works in a big office.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Their corporate jets and <strong>golden parachutes</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An expression for the huge amounts of money or stock that some executives get when they are forced to leave a company (A parachute is the device that allows a person to jump safely out of a plane).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is an <strong>outrage</strong>! <strong>You&rsquo;re out of line</strong>, Gekko!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; is any type of behavior that is considered extremely cruel or inappropriate.</li>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;out of line,&rdquo; they are behaving in a completely inappropriate or unacceptable way.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The new <strong>law of evolution</strong> in corporate America seems to be survival of the <strong>unfittest</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;law of evolution&rdquo; is Charles Darwin&rsquo;s theory of how animals change over millions of years.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Survival of the <em>fittest</em>&rdquo; means that those animals (or businesses) that are the most fit, or strongest, will survive (though note Gekko teases the executives by saying <em>un</em>fittest).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The point is that greed, <strong>for lack of a better word</strong>, is good.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The most famous line in this movie! &ldquo;For lack of&rdquo; a better word is another way of saying &ldquo;because there is no&rdquo; better word.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Greed <strong>clarifies</strong>, <strong>cuts through</strong> and captures the <strong>essence</strong> of the evolutionary spirit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>"To clarify" something is to make it clear, and in this case, "to cut through" is also to clarify or expose it so that it can be clearly seen.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The essence&rdquo; of something is it&rsquo;s central or most important quality.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Greed in all it&rsquo;s forms&hellip;has marked the upward <strong>surge</strong> of mankind.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;surge&rdquo; is a dramatic and fast movement.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m getting <strong>psychotic</strong> from a lack of <strong>REM</strong> sleep.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;psychotic,&rdquo; they are crazy or deluded.</li>

  <li>&ldquo;Movers and shakers&rdquo; are very powerful people in business who effect many others with their financial decisions.</li>

<div class="w3-col s2"><p></p></div>
</div>
<p>
<p><em>Blue Star is an <strong>unpolished gem</strong>, right out of the garbage.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;unpolished gem&rdquo; is a piece of jewelry that is not recognized for its beauty because it has not been polished or cleaned. This is Bud&rsquo;s way of saying people are unaware of how valuable Blue Star Airlines is.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A <strong>half-assed</strong> management being <strong>decimated</strong> by a price war they cannot win, but <strong>the gates at La Guardia</strong> can <strong>bail us out</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a management team is &ldquo;half-assed,&rdquo; they are not serious or good.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To decimate&rdquo; something is to completely destroy it.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;gates at La Guardia&rdquo; are slots or spaces at the La Guardia airport in New York.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To bail out&rdquo; a person is a slangy way of saying to save or help them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve got <strong>mixed emotions</strong>, like Larry Wildman going off a <strong>cliff</strong> in my new <strong>Maserati</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person has &ldquo;mixed emotions&rdquo; about something, they feel confused or conflicted by it (happy and sad).</li>
  <li>A "cliff" is the edge of a very steep face of rock, high above a lower level.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;Maserati&rdquo; is a very expensive Italian sports car.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting one thing? <strong>Capital reserves</strong>. This company has 75 million cash in over-funded <strong>pensions</strong>. That buys us some <strong>credibility</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Capital reserves&rdquo; is the amount of cash that a person or company can use if quickly needed.</li>
  <li>A "pension" is a retirement account paid for by both the employer and employee, in this case for the workers of the airline (If it is "over-funded," there is actually more money in it than is legally required for the airline to pay out).</li>
  <li>"Credibility" is believability.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The beauty is you already own close to 2% of this <strong>sucker</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A silly but common slang word for a person, thing, or here, company.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m <strong>up to my ass</strong> in more <strong>nuts</strong> than a <strong>fruitcake</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A silly play on words; If a person is &ldquo;up to their ass&rdquo; in nuts, they are surrounded by them.</li>
  <li>Of course, in this case, a &ldquo;nut&rdquo; is a crazy person, and not a snack food.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;fruitcake&rdquo; is a traditional Christmas cake that contains many types of fruit and nut.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The hourly cost of a <strong>flight crew</strong> is $850 an hour.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;flight crew&rdquo; on a plane includes the pilots and cabin attendants, who serve the food in flight.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bud is a <strong>born liar</strong>, but otherwise he&rsquo;s a good kid.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A person who is &ldquo;a born liar&rdquo; has, of course lied from the time they were a baby. Any noun could work: A born politician, athlete, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>No offense. :: None taken.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>"No offense" are the words you use if you have just said something that could hurt or offend the person you're speaking to, and "none taken" is what that person says back, unless they really were offended!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I got <strong>roasted</strong> the other night; A friend asked &ldquo;Why are we <strong>honoring</strong> this man? Have we run out of human beings?&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To roast&rdquo; a well known person at a dinner is to come together to both honor and make fun of them.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To honor&rdquo; a person is to show them great respect, usually for what they have accomplished.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve got losses of $20-30,000,000, dividends cut to zero, and you&rsquo;re being <strong>squeezed</strong> to death by the majors.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is Gekko&rsquo;s way of saying that competition from the big airlines is threatening to destroy Blue Star.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To squeeze&rdquo; is to press or hold very tightly together.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Present management may not be the worst <strong>scum of the earth</strong>, but they&rsquo;re the guys who put you on this <strong>kamikaze</strong> course.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Scum of the earth&rdquo; is an extremely negative insult to describe a horrible or very immoral person (Scum is the filth that collects on shower tiles).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Kamikaze&rdquo; is a Japanese word for the pilots who agreed to commit suicide by crashing their planes into enemy ships.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pretty soon everybody will be <strong>scrambling</strong> for <strong>parachutes</strong>, only there is not enough to go around.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To scramble&rdquo; is to move or run quickly, often in a desperate attempt to escape.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Parachutes&rdquo; are the devices for jumping out of planes, or here, the huge amounts of money that only top executives get when a company is sold off, or when they agree to leave the company.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If they throw Blue Star into <strong>Chapter 11</strong>, they&rsquo;ll use the <strong>bankruptcy</strong> laws to break your unions, your contracts, and to throw you guys off the property.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; is the well known set of laws that allow a business to &ldquo;declare bankruptcy,&rdquo; which allows the business to avoid paying debts that it still has, since it no longer has any money.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What do you say we <strong>cut to the chase</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you &ldquo;cut to the chase,&rdquo; you start to speak immediately about the most important or critical matter that needs to be discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m asking for a modest 20% <strong>across the board wage cut</strong> and seven more hours a month.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;across the board wage cut&rdquo; means that every single employee in the company will be paid less.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If we&rsquo;re <strong>in the black</strong>, salaries go back to their present levels and we <strong>initiate</strong> an employee <strong>profit sharing</strong> program with stock.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a company is &ldquo;in the black,&rdquo; it is making money (If it is &ldquo;in the red,&rdquo; it is losing money).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To initiate&rdquo; a plan is to start it, and a &ldquo;profit-sharing&rdquo; program is one in which employees get stock in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Effective <strong>inventory management</strong> through computerization will increase our load factor by 5-20%.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Inventory management&rdquo; is a way for companies to have just enough inventory (goods or supplies), but not too much. This is Bud&rsquo;s way of saying they can increase profits by 5-20% if the airline is more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We expand our <strong>hubs</strong> in Atlanta, North Carolina and St. Louis.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;hub&rdquo; is a an airport that serves as a major center of operations for an airline, from which planes fly to other less important cities.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Cards are on the table</strong>; What do you say? :: It&rsquo;s <strong>in the ballpark</strong>; I can take it to my people.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If &ldquo;the cards are on the table,&rdquo; the details of a proposal have been clearly explained.</li>
  <li>If the proposal is &ldquo;in the ballpark,&rdquo; it is worth discussing since it may be acceptable (In this case, to union members).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve sketched some broad strokes. I would like to see the fine print.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, to &ldquo;sketch some broad strokes&rdquo; is to discuss the major points, whereas &ldquo;the fine print&rdquo; are the small but important details (To sketch is to draw, and broad strokes are thick lines or paint).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What else you got in your <strong>bag of tricks</strong>, Mr. Gekko?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;bag of tricks&rdquo; is a bag used by magicians used to help fool or confuse people, and in this case, referring to Gekko&rsquo;s ability to do the same.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There came into Egypt a <strong>pharaoh</strong> that did not know. :: Is that a <strong>proverb</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is spoken like "Biblical English."</li>
  <li>A "pharaoh" is a leader of ancient Egypt, and a proverb is a short well known expression, such as "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>No, a <strong>prophecy</strong>. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; is a prediction, or a powerful guess about the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s only in it for the buck, and he don&rsquo;t take prisoners.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is Carl&rsquo;s way of saying Gekko only wants to make as much money as possible, and he is willing to destroy lives in order to do so (If an enemy doesn&rsquo;t take prisoners, it&rsquo;s because he kills those he captures).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Of course my son did work as a baggage and <strong>freight</strong> handler for three summers.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Freight&rdquo; is transported goods such as large containers of food or furniture, and a freight handler is a person who makes sure such goods are well placed on the plane.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If that&rsquo;s scum, I&rsquo;ll take it over a <strong>rat</strong> any day. You know where <strong>I stand</strong>. Goodnight, all.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A person who is a rat is a horrible person who cannot be trusted.</li>
  <li>To take &ldquo;a stand&rdquo; on an issue is to have an opinion or position.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Save</strong> the &ldquo;<strong>workers of the world, unite</strong>&rdquo; speech. I heard it too much growing up.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this grammatical context, &ldquo;save&rdquo; means stop.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Workers of the world, unite&rdquo; is the famous expression in the "Communist Manifesto" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You are going to be <strong>axed</strong>. You and the whole <strong>shitty</strong> airline are going <strong>right down the tubes</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, if a person is &ldquo;axed,&rdquo; they are fired from their job (An ax is a sharp tool used for cutting wood).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Shitty&rdquo; is a vulgar but common adjective meaning bad or lousy.</li>
  <li>If a business is going &ldquo;right down the tubes,&rdquo; it is going bankrupt and may go out of business.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s using you, kid. He&rsquo;s got your <strong>prick</strong> in his back pocket, but you&rsquo;re too blind to see it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;prick&rdquo; is a slang word for a penis. This is Carl&rsquo;s way of saying that Gekko is manipulating or fooling Bud.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You see a guy who never measured a man&rsquo;s success by the size of his wallet.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To measure a person&rsquo;s success by the size of their wallet&rdquo; is to judge how successful they are by how much money they make.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You never had the <strong>guts</strong> to go out in the world and <strong>stake your own claim</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, &ldquo;guts&rdquo; refers to courage or bravery (Guts are literally stomach intestines).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To stake your claim&rdquo; is to go out and try and create a business or make a lot of money.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>When my men come to me tomorrow morning, <strong>I&rsquo;ll be damned if</strong> I&rsquo;m going to lie to them.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A curious expression that means &ldquo;there is no possible way that&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What if one day you were wrong? For once, if your <strong>compass</strong> was off?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;compass&rdquo; is a tool that sailors use on the ocean to know in what direction they are travelling (North, South, East and West).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Would you be willing <strong>to wreck</strong> your men&rsquo;s future?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To wreck&rdquo; something is to destroy it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t go to sleep with no <strong>whore</strong> and I don&rsquo;t wake up with no <strong>whore</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>We got a guy at Jackson-Steinham buying large <strong>chunks</strong> of Teldar Paper for an off-shore account.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>I got a strange call from the <strong>SEC</strong>. They asked to see my records. This is <strong>heavy</strong>, Bud.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The SEC is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigates illegal stock sales.</li>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; is a slangy way of saying that something is very serious.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They&rsquo;re always looking for <strong>red flags</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; is an expression which is used to describe anything that is suspicious, or which might need to be investigated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They never <strong>come up</strong> with anything, Roger. We&rsquo;re <strong>invulnerable</strong> on this one.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If the government fails to &ldquo;come up&rdquo; with evidence, they fail to find any.</li>
  <li>A person who is &ldquo;invulnerable&rdquo; cannot be caught or hurt.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re only the president of the company. What <strong>the hell</strong> do you know, anyway?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The hell&rdquo; is added to Wh- questions in order to show emotion such as frustration, or here, surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Gekko&rsquo;s got 12% of the stock and climbing, plus he&rsquo;s got the unions <strong>in his back pocket</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have somebody &ldquo;in your pocket,&rdquo; they will do whatever you ask them to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We must have your assurance that you&rsquo;ll pay us back in the first 12 months, and the only way we see this happening is <strong>liquidating</strong> the <strong>hangers</strong> and planes.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To liquidate&rdquo; property is to sell it off to whoever is willing to pay the most.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Hangers&rdquo; are the large buildings where airplanes are repaired.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We got the Bezeebo brothers lined up to build <strong>condos</strong> where the hangers are.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Short for condominiums, which are apartments that are owned, not rented.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I got the Texas boys <strong>drooling</strong> at my kneecaps for the <strong>routes</strong> and the slots.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To drool&rdquo; is to let saliva or spit run out of your mouth, like a baby.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Routes&rdquo; are the cities which airlines fly between, and in this case, a &ldquo;slot&rdquo; is a gate for planes at an airport.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The beauty of the deal is the over-funded pension. $50,000,000 buys him the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees, and he walks with the rest.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>When Gekko buys the airline, he must pay $50,000,000 to the employees for their retirement pensions, but since there may millions more in the fund, he will get whatever is left (If he &ldquo;walks with the rest,&rdquo; he gets the millions that are still left in the fund).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I figure he&rsquo;ll <strong>clear</strong> 60 or 70,000,000 dollars. Not bad for a month&rsquo;s work.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To clear&rdquo; $1,000 is to make that much profit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I just found out about the <strong>garage sale</strong> down at Blue Star.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A sale popular in American homes, in which people sell the thing they no longer want, often out of their garages or front yards.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He <strong>stuck his nose in</strong> the pot once too often and he got stuck.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To stick your nose&rdquo; into other people&rsquo;s business is to try and learn about things that others prefer you don&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You were walking around blind without a <strong>cane</strong>. A <strong>fool</strong> and his money are not likely to get together.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A "cane" is a stick that blind people use to be able to walk around without a dog or human help.</li>
  <li>A "fool" is a silly or stupid person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>I gave him my word</strong>. :: It&rsquo;s all about bucks, kid.</em></p>

<p><em>How many <strong>yachts</strong> can you water ski behind? How much is enough?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A large luxurious boat that rich people love to own.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a <strong>zero-sum game</strong>. Somebody wins, somebody loses.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;zero-sum game&rdquo; is a game or situation in which every dollar or property gained by one person must be lost by another.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2/3 of that wealth comes from <strong>inheritance</strong>, <strong>interest</strong> accumulated by widows and idiot sons, and what I do, stock and real estate <strong>speculation</strong>. It&rsquo;s <strong>bullshit</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Inheritance&rdquo; is money passed down from one generation to the next.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Interest&rdquo; is the money a borrower pays for a loan, and &ldquo;speculation&rdquo; is investment in an asset such as real estate , in the belief that it will rise in value.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; is a vulgar but great word for nonsense, lies, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The news, war, peace, <strong>famine</strong>, <strong>upheaval</strong>. The price of a paper clip.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Famine&rdquo; is mass starvation, and &ldquo;upheaval&rdquo; is violent social unrest.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Yeah, you got that <strong>killer instinct</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;killer instinct&rdquo; is the intense desire or drive to win at any cost, no matter how badly somebody else gets hurt.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tell them I want <strong>zip-locked mouths</strong> on the Blue Star deal, or I&rsquo;ll personally come down there and <strong>rip out</strong> there fucking throats.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Zip locked mouths&rdquo; is Gekko&rsquo;s term for mouths that don&rsquo;t talk or give away secrets.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To rip out&rdquo; something is to violently remove it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been played like a <strong>grand piano</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;grand piano&rdquo; is a large concert piano. This is Bud&rsquo;s way of saying that he has been skillfully manipulated or used by Gekko.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s going to <strong>carve</strong> Blue Star into little pieces and sell it all off. <strong>Bastard</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To carve&rdquo; something is to slice it, often with a very sharp knife.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Bastard&rdquo; is a vulgar but common word for a mean or abusive man.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I handed it to him on a silver <strong>platter</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;platter&rdquo; is a large dish used for serving food.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To hand it to a person on a silver platter&rdquo; is to make it easy for them to get what they want.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t <strong>cross</strong> Gordon. He&rsquo;ll <strong>crush</strong> you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To cross&rdquo; a friend or ally is to trick them or work against their interests.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To crush&rdquo; a person is to physically press against them with great force, or more generally here, to destroy them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>At least I won&rsquo;t be pulling the <strong>trigger</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; of a gun is the device that is pulled to actually shoot it. Bud&rsquo;s way of saying he won&rsquo;t be the person ultimately responsible.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Cut</strong> the <strong>self-pity</strong> <strong>crap</strong>, Bud.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person tells you to &ldquo;cut&rdquo; something, they are saying to stop it.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Self-pity&rdquo; is the act of feeling sorry for yourself, and &ldquo;crap&rdquo; is a vulgar word which means nonsense, lies, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I guess without Gordon&rsquo;s money and <strong>seal of approval</strong>, I&rsquo;m not such a hot investment anymore.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;seal of approval&rdquo; is simply a sign of approval or endorsement (A seal is an official mark stuck to a written document). This is Bud&rsquo;s way of admitting that Darien may not be interested in him if Gekko is no longer there to pay him so much money.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Get the fuck out of here!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A vulgar but grammatically glorious way to simply say &ldquo;leave!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The market</strong> is dead now. Even the rich are <strong>bitching</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this film, &ldquo;the market&rdquo; is always the stock market.</li>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;bitching,&rdquo; they are complaining.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The only thing moving is the Puerto Ricans and the <strong>cockroaches</strong>, and with the <strong>commission</strong> I get&hellip;</em></p>

  forget, and helps the US Government grab a very rich criminal....</h4></div>

<p>
<p><em>He was complaining about chest pains, and the next thing they know, he&rsquo;s <strong>collapsed</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person or building &ldquo;collapses,&rdquo; they fall to the ground</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re <strong>pushing your luck</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you &ldquo;push you&rsquo;re luck,&rdquo; you are doing things that are very risky.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The stock is at 19 and going up. Gekko <strong>figures</strong> by breaking up Blue Star, it&rsquo;s worth at least $30 a share.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To figure&rdquo; is a very common way of saying to think or believe.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>When it hits 23, you guys go to Gekko and <strong>lower the boom</strong>; When he learns there&rsquo;s no union <strong>concessions</strong>, he&rsquo;ll <strong>jump ship</strong> and sell everything he&rsquo;s got.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To lower the boom&rdquo; is a slangy way of saying to start a forceful attack. (A nautical phrase--a "boom" is the lower horizontal pole attached to a main sail. When it is lowered, the sail takes more wind and moves faster.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Concessions&rdquo; are promises to compromise, such as agreeing to accept less salary.</li>
  <li>If a person &ldquo;jumps ship,&rdquo; they try to run away or escape. (Another nautical term. People "jump ship" when the ship is in danger--jumping means getting off the ship.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s to prevent some other <strong>shark</strong> from coming along and <strong>devouring</strong> us?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;shark&rdquo; is a deadly fish, of course, and a ruthless or immoral business man. &ldquo;To devour&rdquo; food is to eat it with great pleasure.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What would you say to owning Blue Star Airlines with union concessions for $18 a share, and in the process, hanging Gekko <strong>out in the wind to twist</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is left &ldquo;out in the wind to twist,&rdquo; they are at the mercy of nature after being completely defeated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why you, <strong>mate</strong>? What&rsquo;s a <strong>bloke</strong> like you doing <strong>mixed up</strong> with Gekko?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Mate&rdquo; is a British word for friend, and &ldquo;bloke&rdquo; is a British word for guy.</li>
  <li>To be &ldquo;mixed up&rdquo; with a person is to be involved with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We want a contract agreement that&rsquo;s <strong>ironclad</strong>; If you buy it, you can&rsquo;t break it up.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;ironclad&rdquo; contract is one that can&rsquo;t be changed or manipulated. Duncan wants to make sure the airline will survive if Larry buys it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve been a real <strong>schmuck</strong> lately::I want to <strong>make it up</strong> to you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Schmuck&rdquo; is a great Jewish word for a jerk or idiot.</li>
  <li>If you try to &ldquo;make it up&rdquo; to somebody, you try to do something good in exchange for having done something bad in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Blue Star is in play. Let&rsquo;s <strong>check it out</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To check out&rdquo; something is a very common way of saying to investigate or look at it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s at 21 and 5/8<sup>th</sup>. I don&rsquo;t know <strong>what to make</strong> of it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;what to make&rdquo; of something, this means you don&rsquo;t know what it means or whether it is even important.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The <strong>word is out</strong>, pal. You&rsquo;re union <strong>buddies</strong> are talking.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If the &ldquo;word is out&rdquo; on something, this means that it is no longer being kept secret.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Buddy&rdquo; is an alternative word for friend or pal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Slash and burn</strong> and buy everything in sight up to 22!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This means to act with great violence, speed and force. &ldquo;To slash&rdquo; something is to cut it to pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The stock is going to Pluto, man. :: Start <strong>unloading</strong>! <strong>Dump</strong> it now!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pluto is the last body in our solar system, and thus if a stock is going there, it is going up very high in value.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To unload&rdquo; or &ldquo;dump&rdquo; a stock is to suddenly sell it as fast as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We know what you&rsquo;re <strong>up to</strong> Gekko, and you can <strong>go straight to hell</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be &ldquo;up to&rdquo; something is simply to be doing it.</li>
  <li>If you tell a person to &ldquo;go to hell,&rdquo; you are strongly insulting them, though this is still gentler than &ldquo;fuck you.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Those <strong>flight reservation systems</strong> can get awfully&nbsp;<strong>screwed up</strong> if we&rsquo;re not paying attention.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;flight reservation system&rdquo; is a computerized system for keeping track of passengers. If it&rsquo;s &ldquo;screwed up,&rdquo; it is working very badly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you want to be <strong>gobbled up</strong> by <strong>Attila the Hun</strong>, be my guest.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be &ldquo;gobbled up&rdquo; is to be eaten or devoured.</li>
  <li>Attila the Hun was a ruthless leader in the middle ages known for killing all his enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Gekko is <strong>on the ropes</strong>! He&rsquo;s trying to sell, but there aren&rsquo;t any takers. The stock is <strong>plummeting</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;on the ropes,&rdquo; they are in very bad trouble. If a stock is &ldquo;plummeting,&rdquo; it is dropping in value extremely fast.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s got to be a <strong>way out</strong> of this, Gordon. :: Why don&rsquo;t you dial <strong>9-1-1</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;way out&rdquo; of a problem is the possible solution.</li>
  <li>9-1-1 is the number you dial in the US if you have an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You take it right in the ass, you fucking <strong>scumbag</strong> cocksucker!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Typical vulgar insults from Gekko, but it&rsquo;s worth noting &ldquo;scumbag,&rdquo; which is a classic insult for a worthless, disgusting or abusive person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Fueled</strong> by <strong>takeover rumors</strong>, the stock <strong>soared</strong> to an all time high of 24 1/8&hellip;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;fueled&rdquo; means powered, or propelled.</li>
  <li>Here, &ldquo;takeover rumors&rdquo; are talk or gossip which suggests a company is about to be bought.</li>
  <li>If a stock price &ldquo;soars,&rdquo; it goes up very fast, like a bird.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;.and then when <strong>contradictory</strong> rumors later surfaced that the takeover was <strong>unfounded</strong>&hellip;.the stock plummeted to 16 before closing at 17.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If another rumor is &ldquo;contradictory,&rdquo; it conflicts with, or is, the exact opposite of the previous one.</li>
  <li>If news is &ldquo;unfounded,&rdquo; it not true.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tonight another <strong>rumble</strong> shook the street; According to many sources, raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has bought a <strong>substantial block</strong> of Blue Star.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;rumble&rdquo; is a loud noise, such as when a truck drives by.</li>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;a substantial block&rdquo; of a company is a large percentage of their stock.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Man looks into the <strong>abyss</strong>; There&rsquo;s nothing <strong>staring</strong> back at him. At that moment he finds his <strong>character</strong>, and that keeps him out of the abyss.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;abyss&rdquo; is a bottomless black hole.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To stare&rdquo; at a person is to look at them without turning away.</li>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;character&rdquo; is courage or true inner feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Postal Inspector Service. The Security and Exchange Enforcement Office.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two agencies in the federal government that investigate and prosecute people for violations of the securities (stock) laws.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re under arrest, Mr. Fox, for <strong>conspiracy to commit securities fraud</strong>, and for violating the <strong>Insider Traders Sanction Act</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Conspiracy to commit securities fraud&rdquo; is the act of working with others to buy and sell stock in a way that is not honest or ethical.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;Insider Traders Sanction Act&rdquo; is a law to prevent people from buying and selling stock based on secret company information.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You have the right to remain silent&hellip;.anything you do say may be used against you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Very famous words in American culture that the police must tell all people as soon as they arrest them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You taught the teacher a lesson&hellip;that <strong>the tail can wag the dog</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>When a dog &ldquo;wags&rdquo; its tail, it shakes it back and forth. An expression which suggests the less powerful can still fool or trick the powerful.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let me <strong>clue you in</strong>, pal. The ice is melting right underneath your feet.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To clue in&rdquo; a person is to let them know of some key information.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You think you could have gotten this far this fast with someone else? You think you&rsquo;d be <strong>dicking</strong> someone like Darien?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gekko&rsquo;s way of telling Bud he should have been appreciative to him for helping him make so much money so fast (&ldquo;Dick&rdquo; is a common slang word for a penis, but the verb to dick is never used).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You told the truth and gave the money back. All things considered in this <strong>cockamamie</strong> world, you&rsquo;re <strong>shooting par</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Cockamamie&rdquo; is an interesting adjective meaning crazy.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To shoot par&rdquo; is a golfing term, which here means to be even (not ahead or behind).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to jail. :: Maybe in some kind of <strong>screwed up way</strong>, it&rsquo;s the best thing that could have happened to you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, to look at a situation &ldquo;in a screwed up way&rdquo; is to see it from a very different or unusual point of view.</li>
