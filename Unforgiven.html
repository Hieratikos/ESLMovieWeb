<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
    This film is considered one of the truly great Westerns, a type of movie that deals with
    life in the "Wild West" of the 19th century. It is the story of Will Munny, a poor Kansas
    pig farmer who had been considered one of the cruelest and best gunfighters in the West,
    but who had become much less violent and gentler ever since he got married. As the movie
    begins, Will is struggling to raise his two young children alone because his wife had died
    of a disease two years earlier.
<p>
    Will is pulled back into a life of violence after events that take place in the tiny town
    of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, in 1880. One day, a young prostitute named Delilah is horribly hurt
    by a cowboy who attacks her face with a knife. The sheriff of the town refuses to punish the
    cowboys, but instead forces them to pay the prostitutes' business manager several horses, for
    the loss of income that he will suffer since Delilah will no longer be able to charge much
    money for sex. The prostitutes working with her become so offended and angry by this situation
    that they soon offer a $1,000 bounty (reward) to the first people that will kill the cowboys who
    had cut up Delilah's face.
<p>
  Will hears of this news from the Schofield kid, who had come to ask if he would help him kill the
  cowboys in exchange for a part of the reward money. Reluctantly, Will agrees, and soon Will's old
  friend Ned also joins them. The three of them travel to Northern Wyoming in hopes of finding the
  cowboys and collecting the money, but soon things start to go wrong in this very violent part of
  the American West.
<p>
  An Important Note on the Language Used in the Movie: Although this film is a good look at life in
  the last years of the Western frontier, the language that is used should be learned with caution.
  This is because while there is a lot of useful vocabulary here, the dialog is filled with old and
  ungrammatical English that should be understood but avoided when speaking. Among the most common
  examples found throughout the movie are the following:
<br>
-Double (and triple!) negatives: "She didn't know no better."<br>
-The constant use of ain't: "You ain't going to whip them?"<br>
-Bad verb conjugation: "We was tired."<br>
-The use of them between verb and noun: "Get them horses in the barn."

  <ul>
  <li>If a person insults an entire race or group of people, they can say "present company excluded" to show they make an exception for those people of that race or group who are in the same room as the speaker.

  <ul>
  <li>In the Old West, "dude" meant something different than what it means today. In the old days, a "dude" was someone who

  </ul>
  <p><em>It's a <strong>savage</strong> country; That's the second one they shot in 20 years.</em></p>

  </ul>
  <p><em>It's uncivilized shooting <strong>persons of substance</strong>.</em></p>

  <li>A useful word for strong and not easily weakened, or perhaps violent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>There's a dignity in royalty, a majesty which <strong>precludes</strong> the likelihood of <strong>assassination</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To preclude" is to prevent," and an "assassination" is the murder of a important person. This is English Bob's silly way of saying that people would be too scared to shoot a king or queen, but not a president. Again, he is being insulting.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>If you were to point a pistol at a king or queen, your hand would shake as if <strong>palsied</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
