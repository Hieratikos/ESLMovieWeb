<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
    This movie is the classic story of racism in a small fictional town in the
    American South, based on the book of the same title by Harper Lee. The
    story takes place in 1932, during the great economic depression, in Macomb,
    Alabama. It is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, a six year
    old girl who loves her father very much, and who observes the great
    difficulties that he faces after he decides to defend a black man, Tom
    Robinson, who is falsely accused of raping a poor white teenage girl. In
    telling her story, she reveals much about race, social class and the law in
    1930s America.
<p>
    After deciding to take Tom's case, Atticus must deal with many serious
    problems, from the fact that other kids at his children's school make fun
    of his kids because their father was "defending a nigger," to doing
    everything he can to defend Tom Robinson's life from a white mob that was
    determined to kill him before he even had a chance to have a trial.
    However, the trial does eventually take place, and in it, Atticus uses his
    great skills as a lawyer to clearly show that Tom Robinson was not guilty
    of rape, and that in fact Mayella Ewell was the victim of her own desires,
    her father's brutality and the morals of Southern society. By the end, the
    truth becomes obvious to everyone, except the 12 white men on the jury.
<p>
    While all of this is happening, Scout, Jem and their friend Dill continue
    to explore the world of the mysterious "Boo" Radley, a young man who has
    not been seen in years, and who many believe is crazy. Many also think that
    Boo's scary and strange father, who never talks to anyone, has tied him up
    to a bed inside their scary and poor house, just down the road. But one day
    Boo appears in their lives, and in an amazing climax to this story, saves
    them from the hate that had so badly hurt their town.
<p>
    <strong>A Brief Historical Note on the American South:</strong>
    Racism exists everywhere, but until the 1960s, there were few places in
    the industrialized world where it was so openly accepted as the Southern
    states of the US. The Civil War of the 1860s put an end to slavery within
    these states, but legal discrimination would last for at least another
    century. Thus, for example, blacks in the South were almost never allowed
    to sit on juries, and both law and social mores strictly forbid the mixing
    of blacks and whites in many social settings. It is within this segregated
    and repressive context that a decent man like Atticus was forced to work
    and raise his family.
<p>
    <strong>A Quick Note on the Language:</strong>
    Do not be discouraged! Scout, Jem and Dill are very difficult to understand
    at first since they use a lot of old words, speak very quickly and have
strong Southern accents. It becomes easier as the movie goes on.

<ul>
<li>"Pity" is concern for someone, but primarily because you feel sorry for them as a person. Generally, a negative word.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>But my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man's life <strong>at stake</strong> <strong>to get rid of</strong> her own guilt.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"At stake" is another way to say at risk.</li>
<li>"To get rid of" something is a common and colloquial way to say to throw away or eliminate.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>She has committed no crime. She has <strong>merely</strong> broken <strong>a rigid and time-honored code</strong> of our society.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Merely" is an interesting little word meaning "only."</li>
<li>Something that is "rigid" is unbending, and here, a "code" is an accepted way of behavior, perhaps even a law.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A code so <strong>severe</strong> that whoever breaks it is <strong>hounded</strong> from our <strong>midst</strong> as <strong>unfit</strong> to live with.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Severe" is a strong adjective meaning strict or harsh or perhaps unforgiving.</li>
<li>"To hound" someone is to chase them away.</li>
<li>To be in one's "midst" is to be in the center or close by, and "unfit" is another strong adjective meaning unqualified.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What did she do? She <strong>tempted</strong> a Negro, and in our society it is <strong>unspeakable</strong>....and the code came <strong>crashing down on</strong> her afterwards.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To tempt" is to try and attract or seduce.</li>
<li>If something is "unspeakable," it is considered so bad or horrible that it cannot be discussed.</li>
<li>"To crash down" on someone is to fall on them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The witnesses for the state had cynical confidence that you'd <strong>go along with</strong> them on the evil a<strong>ssumption</strong> that all negros lie and are immoral <strong>beings</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To go along with" something is to agree to accept it.</li>
<li>An "assumption" is a statement or claim that is accepted as true.</li>
<li>"Beings" is short for human beings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Negro men are not to be trusted around our women. This is an assumption we associate with minds of their <strong>caliber</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An educated word for distinction, or here, intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And so a <strong>humble</strong> quiet Negro who has had the <strong>unmitigated temerity</strong> to feel sorry for a white woman....</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Humble" is an important adjective meaning modest.</li>
<li>"Unmitigated temerity" is one way to say the "pure nerve" or "audacity," and is said here with sarcastic anger.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>....has had to put <strong>his word</strong> against two white people.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In a legal context, "your word" is your solemn promise.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our courts are the great <strong>levelers</strong>, and in our courts, all men are created equal.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To level" something is to make it flat, and here the idea is that in theory, the courts treat all people the same, black or white.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now, I'm no <strong>idealist</strong> to believe firmly in the <strong>integrity</strong> of our courts and our jury system....It's a living, working reality.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An "idealist" is someone who is overly romantic or optimistic about how well certain institutions, such as the justice system, can work.</li>
<li>"Integrity" is another word for honesty or morality.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I'm confident you gentlemen will review the evidence without passion...and <strong>restore</strong> this man to his family.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To restore" something is to return it to the way it was before.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In the name of God</strong> , do your duty.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a very powerful way to urge people to do something.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How long <strong>has the jury been out</strong>, Reverend?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If the jury is "out," the members are in the process of discussing the evidence behind closed doors, before reaching a decision.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Have you reached a <strong>verdict</strong>? :: We have, <strong>your honor</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A "verdict" is the legal conclusion as to whether a person is guilty or not guilty of the criminal charges.</li>
<li>"Your honor" is the way all people in court are expected to address a judge.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The jury is <strong>dismissed</strong>. Court is <strong>adjourned</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A jury that is "dismissed" is officially ended since they have done their job.</li>
<li>If court is "adjourned," it is ended for the day.</li>

<p>1. What does this movie tell us about American life in 1932?</p>
<p>2. Is the US still a racist society? Is it as bad as it was back then? What about your own country? Who are the "negroes" of the culture that you come from?</p>
<p>3. Atticus said that he had to defend Tom Robinson so that he could walk in town "with his head up" (without being ashamed). What were the principles that Atticus was defending? If you had been in his position in that town at that time, would you have had the courage to do what he did?</p>
<p>4. Why do you think this story was told from the point of view of a child?</p>
<p>5. How would you describe Atticus to a friend? What about Scout? And Jem?</p>
<p>6. In a very powerful scene, Scout's talking to Mr. Cunningham seems to prevent the white mob from killing Tom Robinson. What does that scene seem to imply about hatred, violence, and human nature?</p>
<p>7. Why did Mr. Radley scare so many people in town? Does every town have somebody like him?</p>
<p>8. Atticus believes that the search for truth is one of the greatest principles, but at the end of the film, he seems to agree with Sheriff Tate that the death of Mr. Ewell should be considered an accident. Given the nature of the town, the circumstances in which Boo became involved, and Boo's "shy ways," was agreeing to the sheriff's "version of reality" the right thing to do?</p>
