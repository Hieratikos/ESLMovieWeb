    <h1 style="text-align:center">Plot Summary</h1>
  </div>
<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
  This is a movie based on a true story that occurred in Southern California in the mid 1990s.
  At that time, Erin Brockovich was a very strong and independent divorced mother of three who
  was struggling to survive financially when she becomes injured in a car accident. She hires a
  lawyer named Ed Masry who promises to get her money for her injuries, but because Erin is
  very emotional and loves to use foul language, a jury refuses to award her any money. Desperate
  for income,  Erin convinces Ed to hire her as an office clerk, and it is there that Erin becomes
  a great investigator.
<p>
  After looking into a simple property case from Ed’s files, Erin soon discovers that many people
  have become horribly sick in the small desert town of Hinkley, about two hours East of Los Angeles.
  She begins to investigate the situation as if she were a well trained lawyer, but in fact, she had
  never been to law school. What she gradually learns is that the huge Pacific Gas and Electric Company
  (PG&E) was letting  a toxic chemical called Hexavalent Chromium 6 spread throughout the Hinkley water
  supply, and that this was in turn causing hundred of residents to get cancer and other deadly diseases.
<p>
  A lawsuit against a huge company is an expensive and very risky process, and thus much of this story
  concerns Erin’s endless attempts to convince the town’s residents as well as her new boss, Ed, her
  new boyfriend, George, and even her own children that the enormous time and energy that such a struggle
  will require is still worth the effort. In the end, this is the story of Erin’s incredible energy and
  determination, and how it helped a lot of very poor and mistreated people find some real justice.

  <p><strong>New Words and Expressions:</strong></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve seen nurses give my son <strong>throat cultures</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A medical test in which a cotton swab (Q-tip) is put down a person&rsquo;s throat in order to look for bacteria or other infections.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A <strong>urinalysis</strong>, where you take that <strong>dipstick</strong> to see if the <strong>white count</strong> is high.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;urinalysis&rdquo; is a test that is done to analyze what is inside a person&rsquo;s urine (piss).</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;dipstick&rdquo; is a stick that is placed inside a liquid, such as car oil, to see how much liquid is present.</li>
  <li>In this context, &ldquo;white count&rdquo; refers to the count or number of white blood cells.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You show me something in a <strong>lab</strong> once, and <strong>I got it down</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A "lab" is short for a laboratory, where scientific or medical experiments are done.</li>
  <li>If a person has "got it down," they have mastered a particular topic or piece of information. This is Erin's way of saying that she learns very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I always wanted to go to medical school, but I kind of <strong>blew</strong> that.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To blow it&rdquo; is a great colloquial expression which means to do something very badly, or fail at it completely.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My boy <strong>came down with</strong> the <strong>chicken pox</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To come down&rdquo; with a disease is to get sick because of it.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Chicken Pox&rdquo; is a common childhood disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My ex-husband was <strong>useless</strong>, too, so that <strong>didn&rsquo;t really work out</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Useless&rdquo; is a very strong insult if used when describing a person.</li>
  <li>If a situation &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work out,&rdquo; it ends up badly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Awe, fuck, god damn it!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two common but vulgar obscenities to express emotion such as anger or frustration.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>She was <strong>referred</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a client is &ldquo;referred,&rdquo; they choose to go to a particular lawyer or other professional because of a personal recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I never thought just standing could <strong>take it out of you</strong>, but ever since that <strong>shithead</strong> hit me&hellip;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something &ldquo;takes it out of you,&rdquo; it takes all your energy and leaves you extremely tired.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Shithead&rdquo; is a crude but excellent insult word to describe a jerk, bastard, ass, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Whoever did this to you made <strong>one hell of a mistake</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A set expression placed before a noun to show emphasis (&ldquo;They made a very big mistake&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Out of nowhere</strong>, his <strong>Jaguar</strong> came racing around the corner <strong>like a bat out of hell</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If somebody comes &ldquo;out of nowhere,&rdquo; they arrive suddenly and unexpectedly.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;Jaguar&rdquo; is a well-known sport car (and a beautiful big cat), and to move &ldquo;like a bat of out of hell&rdquo; is to go extremely quickly, perhaps because of great fear.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I couldn&rsquo;t take pain killers because they made me too <strong>groggy</strong> to take care of my kids.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Groggy&rdquo; means very sleepy, or lacking the energy to focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s the point</strong>? :: <strong>Broke</strong>, three kids, no job. A doctor in a Jaguar must have looked like a pretty good <strong>meal ticket</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; is an excellent way of asking a person what they are really trying to say.</li>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;broke,&rdquo; they have no money.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;meal ticket&rdquo; is a silly expression for a potential source of money.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Objection! :: Sustained!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In a trial, if a lawyer yells &ldquo;objection,&rdquo; they are asking the judge to stop another lawyer or witness from saying things that are irrelevant to the trial and that the jury should not hear.</li>
  <li>If a judge says &ldquo;sustained,&rdquo; she is agreeing with that lawyer&rsquo;s objection.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>He came <strong>tearing around the corner</strong> out of control.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a car is &ldquo;tearing around a corner,&rdquo; it is driving and turning extremely quickly, probably in a way that is not safe.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>An <strong>ER</strong> doctor who spends his days saving lives was out of control?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;ER&rdquo; is short for emergency room.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That <strong>asshole</strong> <strong>smashed</strong> in my <strong>fucking</strong> neck!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Asshole&rdquo; is a very common insult word which is much more vulgar than jerk, creep, etc.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To smash in&rdquo; something is to crush or destroy it.</li>
  <li>Note the use of &ldquo;fucking&rdquo; as an adjective, which is very crude, and very common in this movie.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Open and fucking shut!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;open and shut&rdquo; case is one that is expected to succeed very easily, because the law or facts are so in favor of one side. Here, Erin is being very angry and sarcastic.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I told you the questions might get <strong>personal</strong>! :: No, you told me I&rsquo;d be <strong>set</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If questions get &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; they involve people&rsquo;s private lives.</li>
  <li>In this context, if a person is &ldquo;set,&rdquo; they are placed in a good or favorable situation (Here, Erin thought she&rsquo;d get a lot of money).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You told me I had <strong>a good shot</strong>. I had no shot!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;A good shot&rdquo; at being able to do or accomplish something is a good chance or possibility of doing it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s <strong>settle down</strong>. :: Fuck &ldquo;settle down!,&rdquo; I got $74 in the bank.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To &ldquo;settle down&rdquo; is to calm down, or act more quietly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do they teach lawyers to apologize? Because you <strong>suck at it</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person &ldquo;sucks at&rdquo; doing something, they&rsquo; re very bad at it.</li>

<ul>
  <li>A person who pays a professional person, especially a lawyer, for services and advice.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s two things that <strong>aggravate</strong> me, Mr. Masry.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To aggravate&rdquo; a person is to anger or upset them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t need <strong>pity</strong>. I need a paycheck.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Pity&rdquo; is the feeling others have for a person that they feel sorry for.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s hard to get a job that pays <strong>worth a damn</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>We have a <strong>full staff</strong> right now. :: <strong>Bullshit</strong>! If you had a full staff, this office would return a client&rsquo;s damn phone calls.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If an office has a &ldquo;full staff,&rdquo; then all the positions are filled and there are no available job.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; is a classic obscenity that means lies, distortions of the truth, or just nonsense.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If something &ldquo;works out well,&rdquo; it is considered successful.</li>

<p><em>No benefits.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In an employment context, &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; refer to the things workers get beside just their salary, such as health insurance and paid vacations.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>At any time, we can tell the <strong>status</strong> of a <strong>file</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The &ldquo;status&rdquo; of something is its current position or situation, and in this case, a &ldquo;file&rdquo; is the paperwork for one particular legal case.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do I get to pick my own <strong>code</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A system of words, letters or numbers that are either designed to keep a message secret or to help start up or use a machine.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>I was wondering</strong>, can you tell me who I talk to about getting an <strong>advance</strong> on my paycheck?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;I was wondering&rdquo; is an excellent and gentle way of starting to talk about something that is sensitive or delicate. An &ldquo;advance&rdquo; on a paycheck is a payment that is made before it is due.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rosalind <strong>handles</strong> the <strong>payroll</strong> and <strong>petty cash</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To handle&rdquo; something is to take care of it.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Payroll&rdquo; is the part of a business that deals with writing all the paychecks for its employees, and &ldquo;petty cash&rdquo; is the money that is given to employees to pay for minor business-related expenses such as office supplies.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>With all the numbers I gave you, I guess zero is the number of times you&rsquo;re <strong>gonna</strong> call it.</em></p>

<p><em>If PG&amp;E <strong>messed with</strong> our water, why wouldn&rsquo;t they just keep quiet about it?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, &ldquo;to mess with&rdquo; something is to mistreat it or abuse it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To establish a <strong>statute of limitations</strong> <strong>to file suit</strong>. PG&amp;E figures we&rsquo;ll <strong>let the cat out of the bag</strong>, tell people the water&rsquo;s not perfect&hellip;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;statute of limitations&rdquo; is a legal term that refers to the last point in time in which something can take place.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To file suit&rdquo; is to bring a law suit in a court, usually demanding money for what somebody has done in the past.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To let the cat out of the bag&rdquo; is to tell a secret to others that they didn&rsquo;t know before.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;and if we can <strong>ride out</strong> a year with no one suing, we&rsquo;ll <strong>be in the clear</strong> forever.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To ride out&rdquo; a period of time is to survive it without being too hurt.</li>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;in the clear,&rdquo; they are no longer in danger (In this case, in danger of being sued).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And for you two, a comparable <strong>retroactive</strong> <strong>bonus</strong> on your sale price.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a policy or contract is &ldquo;retroactive,&rdquo; it applies to events that took place at an earlier date.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; is an extra amount of money beyond what is usually expected (Here, PG&amp;E is willing to pay more for the Jensen&rsquo;s house then they agreed to earlier, in hopes they won&rsquo;t later sue).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s why PG&amp;E can still look good to their <strong>shareholders</strong>, because they&rsquo;re not involved in an ugly lawsuit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Shareholders&rdquo; are people who own the stock of a company.</li>

<p><em><strong>Boy</strong>, do I know how you feel! The first time I heard that number, I said &ldquo;<strong>You got to be kidding me</strong>.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Boy&rdquo; at the beginning of a sentence is way of expressing great surprise or amazement (And note that &ldquo;I do know&rdquo; is inverted grammatically for emotional emphasis).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;You got to be kidding&rdquo; is a way of expressing great disbelief.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>40 <strong>God damn</strong> percent?! This <strong>joker</strong> sits at a desk all day and he wants to walk away with about half my award.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;God damn&rdquo; is a crude but common way of showing emotion such as anger.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;joker&rdquo; is a clown, or perhaps a fool.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Plus, he&rsquo;s <strong>out all the costs</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a lawyer is &ldquo;out the costs&rdquo; of a law suit, he has to pay all the expenses, such as support staff, even if their clients win no money.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bunt cake.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A type of yellow cake that has no frosting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Seems like everybody in the family ended up with a <strong>rash</strong> somehow.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;rash&rdquo; is a group of red spots on the skin that is caused by illness.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I never did <strong>keep track</strong> of it&hellip;.I just couldn&rsquo;t <strong>get rid of</strong> it, that&rsquo;s all.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To keep track&rdquo; of something is to follow or observe it through time.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To get rid&rdquo; of something is to eliminate it or perhaps throw it away.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Can I ask why? :: <strong>What&rsquo;s the point?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A very useful way of asking a person what they are trying to say, or in this case, of simply asking &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You people <strong>don&rsquo;t give a shit</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t give a shit&rdquo; about something, they don&rsquo;t care about it. Vulgar, but very common.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You <strong>drive all the boys crazy</strong>, don&rsquo;t you?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to drive the boys crazy&rdquo; is to make them want you.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We add <strong>plaintiffs</strong>, and suddenly were in the middle of a <strong>toxic tort</strong>&hellip;</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;plaintiff&rdquo; is a legal word for a person who sues another for a harm that was done to them.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;toxic tort&rdquo; is a lawyer&rsquo;s way of referring to a lawsuit with a plaintiff who was harmed by something poisonous.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;.with a <strong>statute</strong> problem against a <strong>massive utility</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;statute&rdquo; is another word for a law, &ldquo;massive&rdquo; means extremely big, and a &ldquo;utility&rdquo; is a company that provides electricity, gas or water (The statute problem is the deadline by which a suit must be filed).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Work hard?! I built a <strong>firm</strong> and managed to keep it alive through lawsuits, <strong>injunctions</strong> and <strong>evictions</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, a &ldquo;firm&rdquo; is a law firm, or an office with several lawyers working together.</li>
  <li>An &ldquo;injunction&rdquo; is an order by a judge to do or stop doing something or face punishment.</li>
  <li>An &ldquo;eviction&rdquo; is the legal process of removing a person from a building.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A quadruple bypass.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A very serious form of heart surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Diabetes.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A disease in which a person&rsquo;s blood sugar is not at a normal level.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They&rsquo;re a <strong>huge</strong> corporation; They can bury us in <strong>paperwork</strong> for the next 15 years.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Huge&rdquo; means extremely big.</li>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;paperwork&rdquo; is forms and documents that must be filled out and processed in order to continue with a lawsuit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>With a little effort, I really think that we can <strong>nail their asses to the wall</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To nail a person&rsquo;s ass to the wall&rdquo; is a crude but interesting way of saying to capture or punish them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s why these cases <strong>settle</strong>. <strong>Lack of</strong> money.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In law, &ldquo;to settle&rdquo; a case is to reach an agreement between the two parties involved before a trial begins, or at the latest, before the trial ends.</li>
  <li>If there is a &ldquo;lack of&rdquo; something, there isn&rsquo;t enough of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do you know what <strong>toxicologists</strong> and <strong>geology</strong> experts cost?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;toxicologist&rdquo; studies poisons and how they effect humans.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Geology&rdquo; is the study of the earth&rsquo;s surface, rocks, mountains, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re looking at 100 <strong>grand</strong> a month, easy.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;grand&rdquo; is a slangy and common way of saying $1,000 dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve already made a huge <strong>dent</strong> in my savings.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is a &ldquo;huge dent in your savings,&rdquo; you have already lost a lot of the money you had hoped to save (A &ldquo;dent&rdquo; is a small depressed area in a flat surface, as when one car gently hits another).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ll <strong>figure it out</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to figure out&rdquo; something is to try and find a solution to a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Lover&rsquo;s quarrel</strong>? :: <strong>Bite my ass</strong>, <strong>Krispy Kreme</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;lover&rsquo;s quarrel&rdquo; is a heated argument between a couple.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Bite my ass&rdquo; is a silly retort to someone who has insulted you (&ldquo;<em>Kiss</em> my ass&rdquo; is more common, and Krispy Kreme is the name of a donut store--Erin is making fun of the woman's weight).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Toxic test well</strong> from 1967.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A well in which the water is analyzed to see if it contains poisonous substances that are dangerous to the surrounding area.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is a <strong>whole different ball game</strong>; A much <strong>bigger deal</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something is &ldquo;a whole different ball game,&rdquo; it is completely different than what it was being compared to before. If something is a &ldquo;big deal,&rdquo; it is very important.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Kind of like David and <strong>what&rsquo;s-his-name</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s-his-name&rdquo; is what you say when you forget a person&rsquo;s name that you are referring to. In this case, the reference is to David and Goliath, two famous characters in the bible who represent a very powerful person and a very weak one, who eventually fight each other.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If, and only if, you find all the <strong>evidence</strong> <strong>to back this up</strong>, I&rsquo;ll <strong>take it on</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Evidence&rdquo; is the physical facts, from blood to written documents, that tend to prove something in a court of law.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To back up&rdquo; a case is to support it, and if a person &ldquo;takes on&rdquo; something, they agree to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remind me of that when I&rsquo;m <strong>filing for bankruptcy</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To file for bankruptcy&rdquo; is to legally declare that you have no money to pay off your debts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Is this the Erin Patee Brokovich that&rsquo;s been <strong>snooping around</strong> the water board?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To snoop around&rdquo; is to be secretly looking into other people&rsquo;s property or lives without their permission.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You should <strong>watch your step</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of saying "be careful."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not going to quit because of one <strong>creepy</strong> phone call.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An excellent adjective meaning scary or disturbing, like a snake or rat.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The phone might be <strong>tapped</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a phone is &ldquo;tapped,&rdquo; there is a device on the phone line that allows others to secretly listen in on the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ve got a <strong>dead bolt</strong>; it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;dead bolt&rdquo; is a very strong metal lock that is put on doors.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a little <strong>out of your league</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;out of their league,&rdquo; they are trying to compete with or fight against other people or forces that are much stronger than they are (A league is a division or level, especially in professional Sports).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s what those <strong>arrogant</strong> PG&amp;E <strong>fucks</strong> want me to think, but they&rsquo;re wrong.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Arrogant&rdquo; is a very negative adjective meaning snobby, condescending or proud and self-important. Note the use of &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; as a noun, which is a very vulgar insult.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Does PG&amp;E pay you <strong>to cover their ass</strong>, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To cover a person&rsquo;s ass&rdquo; is a crude way of saying to protect them, especially by hiding information that could be embarrassing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. :: <strong>The fuck you don&rsquo;t</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, a vulgar (obviously) and grammatically interesting way of saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe what you just said.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nobody calls me Pattee. That heavy breathing <strong>sicko</strong> that called me the other night could have only found out about me from you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Sicko&rdquo; is a good word for a disturbing person, or one who is willing to hurt people in any way to get what they want.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I want to know how the hell you sleep at night.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, Erin is telling Scott that he should feel so guilty for what he&rsquo;s done that he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Come to think of it</strong>, we had a pretty big event around here.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A common way of saying &ldquo;Now that I think about it&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>She said &ldquo;ball.&rdquo; <strong>Out of the blue</strong>, like that.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something happens &ldquo;out of the blue,&rdquo; it happens totally unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It was pretty <strong>intense</strong>, seeing somebody&rsquo;s first word.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A useful and much loved adjective meaning strong, extreme in degree or size, or perhaps greatly felt.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Her beautiful soft, <strong>chubby</strong> little arms, and her little cheeks.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of saying slightly fat.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our <strong>jaws just dropped</strong>. We must have stood there for three or four minutes.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;jaws drop,&rdquo; they are showing total amazement or surprise (Your jaws are the bottom part of the face in which your teeth are set).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Her little lips <strong>wrapped around it</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To wrap around&rdquo; something is to circle or surround it, though here it&rsquo;s used more generally to mean Beth was able to say a particular word.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Guess what</strong>! :: What?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The words to say when you want to tell a person something interesting or exciting, but perhaps warn them first that you&rsquo;re about to tell them.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The word to use when you are being driven in a car.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They used the <strong>hexavalent chromium</strong> here, as an <strong>anticorrosive</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Hexavalent chromium&rdquo; is the deadly chemical that PG&amp;E used in its plant.</li>
  <li>An &ldquo;anticorrosive&rdquo; substance is designed to prevent rust (which weakens metal).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Then they dump the <strong>excess</strong> water into these <strong>ponds</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Excess&rdquo; is another word for extra, or an amount beyond what is needed. A &ldquo;pond&rdquo; is a small body of water.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you dig one <strong>inch</strong> under the surface, the dirt&rsquo;s as green as a fucking <strong>shamrock</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;inch&rdquo; is a small unit of measurement, about the length of a thumb.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Shamrock&rdquo; is a green clover (flower), and the national symbol of Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s what caused the <strong>contamination</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Contamination&rdquo; is poisonous or unpure matter that pollutes or damages the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In most cases, you&rsquo;d <strong>line</strong> these ponds so this shit doesn&rsquo;t <strong>seep</strong> into the ground.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To line&rdquo; a container is to cover it with an extra layer of material so that it doesn&rsquo;t leak.</li>
  <li>If water &ldquo;seeps&rdquo; into the ground, it slowly leaks and penetrates into it before spreading outward.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Guess what. :: They <strong>skipped</strong> that step?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To skip&rdquo; a step in a process is to forget to do it, or perhaps to decide intentionally not to do it (In this case, to line the ponds).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s like 14 years of hexavalent chromium just <strong>flowing</strong> into the <strong>groundwater</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>When a liquid &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; it moves or pours out.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Groundwater&rdquo; is the water that is found under the surface of the earth.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Nelson cares what&rsquo;s in the pond; He used to spend half the day just <strong>wading</strong> around in them.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To wade&rdquo; in water is to walk through it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s the matter? :: I don&rsquo;t know if we can <strong>pull this off</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the truly great phrasal verbs!; &ldquo;To pull off&rdquo; something is to accomplish it, especially if it is very difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is a monster case; We&rsquo;re up to 44 <strong>plaintiffs</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is Ed&rsquo;s way of saying that the lawsuit is now extremely big, with many people (plaintiffs) now suing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Money is going out, nothing is coming in. I&rsquo;ll have to take a second <strong>mortgage</strong> on the house.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; is the loan that a person gets from a bank when they are about to buy a house.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been making <strong>inquiries</strong> with other <strong>firms</strong>&hellip;.to share some of the cost.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; is an official way of referring to the act of asking for information, or perhaps investigating. Here, &ldquo;firms&rdquo; are law firms.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s <strong>bullshit</strong>! :: We&rsquo;ve got PG&amp;E <strong>by the balls</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; is a vulgar but excellent word for lies, half-truths, nonsense, etc.</li>
  <li>If you got a person &ldquo;by the balls,&rdquo; you have forced them into a difficult situation in which you control what will happen to them (A vulgar but certainly interesting reference to testicles).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>PG&amp;E Hinkley&hellip;. but nobody is going to get rich we until can <strong>pin this on</strong> PG&amp;E corporate in San Francisco. They&rsquo;re not guilty if they didn&rsquo;t know.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To pin a crime on&rdquo; a person is to show others that they are the ones who did it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They had to know. :: Show me the <strong>document</strong> that proves it!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;document&rdquo; is paper with any type of writing on it that can be used to show or prove something (from a personal letter to business forms).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If they didn&rsquo;t know, we can&rsquo;t hit them with <strong>punitive damages</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Punitive damages&rdquo; is money that a person or company is forced to pay if it is shown that they acted with great irresponsibility (It comes from the word punishment).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We file a lawsuit <strong>to provoke</strong> a reaction, to see if they offer a reasonable <strong>settlement</strong> or just throw more paper at us.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To provoke&rdquo; a reaction is to do something that will cause another person to react in some unpredictable way.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; is an agreement by both sides to end a lawsuit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a <strong>downside</strong>. PG&amp;E will <strong>submit a demurrer</strong>&hellip;claiming each <strong>cause of action</strong> has no merit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;downside&rdquo; is a disadvantage.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To submit a demurrer&rdquo; is legal English meaning to officially protest or deny the charges or accusations.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;cause of action &ldquo; is legal English that refers to the official reasons a lawsuit is being pursued. &ldquo;Merit&rdquo; is worth or value, and thus if a lawsuit has no merit, it is not a valid or worthy action.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the judge agrees with them, he&rsquo;ll <strong>dismiss</strong> our case.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a judge &ldquo;dismisses&rdquo; a case, she decides to end it because she feels it is clear that the plaintiff won&rsquo;t be able to win.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Basically, <strong>it all comes down to</strong> what this one judge decides.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;It all comes down to&rdquo; is one way of saying &ldquo;everything depends on&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;d got so used to having this <strong>come up benign</strong>, I guess I just didn&rsquo;t expect it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to come up&rdquo; means to be, though it often means to appear or arrive.</li>
  <li>If a cancer test result is &ldquo;benign,&rdquo; it means that it is not cancerous or dangerous (If it is <em>malignant</em>, it cancerous).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You think if you got no <strong>uterus</strong> and breasts, you&rsquo;re still <strong>technically</strong> a woman.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The uterus is the female organ in which a fetus grows into a baby.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Technically&rdquo; is another way of saying in principle, or in theory.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This lawsuit&hellip;for damages, medical expenses, and personal <strong>trauma</strong> due to contamination of the groundwater in the area by the <strong>defendant</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; is either great medical or emotional harm, often caused by a violent event or sudden shock.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;defendant&rdquo; is the person or company that is being sued by the plaintiff (In this case, PG&amp;E).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I have some 84 <strong>motions to strike</strong> and demurrer submitted by representatives of PG&amp;E, each one attacking the <strong>validity</strong> of this <strong>complaint</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;motion to strike&rdquo; is an official request that the judge immediately deny a particular part of a lawsuit.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;validity&rdquo; of a complaint is its truthfulness, and in a legal context, a &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; is the official charges that are written in the suit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Is there anything anyone wants to say? :: No, <strong>your honor</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The two words you must use whenever you are addressing a judge.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It is the order of <strong>this court</strong>, that each of the 84 motions to strike&hellip;.are denied, and the causes of action against PG&amp;E are upheld.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that although judges are human, they are referred to as &ldquo;the court.&rdquo; Here, the judge is denying PG&amp;E&rsquo;s request that the lawsuit be ended or dismissed.</li>

<p><em>As a resident of <strong>Barstow</strong>, I am <strong>disturbed</strong> by <strong>reference to</strong> <strong>evidence</strong> that suggests not only was hexavalent chromium used&hellip;.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Barstow is a desert town near Hinkley.</li>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;disturbed,&rdquo; they are upset or angry.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Reference to&rdquo; something is the act of mentioning or referring to it, and &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; is any physical object or documents that help prove something in court.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&hellip;.but that your <strong>client</strong> actually sent these <strong>residents</strong> <strong>pamphlets</strong> telling them it was good for them.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;client&rdquo; is a person or company represented by a professional, such as a lawyer.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Residents&rdquo; of a particular place are those people who live there.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;pamphlet&rdquo; is a small book with paper cover that usually deals with a topic of public interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Jesus</strong>, they look like <strong>the Secret Service</strong>. :: <strong>Intimidation</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; is a common way of expressing emotion such as anger or surprise.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;Secret Service&rdquo; is the government agency that protects the President and other high level officials.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Intimidation&rdquo; is the act of trying to scare or threaten someone, either directly or indirectly.</li>

<p><em>$20,000,000 is more money than these people have ever dreamed of. :: See, that <strong>pisses me off</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>They may not be the most <strong>sophisticated</strong> people, but they do know how to <strong>divide</strong>. $20,000,000 isn&rsquo;t <strong>shit</strong> when you split it between them.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; person is very intelligent or educated.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To divide&rdquo; is the opposite of to multiply (10 divided by 2 is 5).</li>
  <li>Note that &ldquo;shit&rdquo; is vulgar but versatile, and here simply means &ldquo;a lot&rdquo;!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They worry about not having to have a <strong>hysterectomy</strong> or have their <strong>spine deteriorate</strong> like Stan Bloom, another client of ours.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;hysterectomy&rdquo; is an operation in which a woman&rsquo;s uterus is removed.</li>
  <li>The &ldquo;spine&rdquo; is the backbone, and if it &ldquo;deteriorates,&rdquo; it starts to become worse or fall apart.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>All I&rsquo;ve done is <strong>bend my life around</strong> what men decided they need. Well, not now.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know if I could <strong>handle</strong> that. <strong>Put the kids through</strong> that.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to handle&rdquo; something is to be able to deal with or manage it.</li>
  <li>If you &ldquo;put a person through&rdquo; something, you are forcing them to experience a situation that may be very stressful or difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>They called <strong>county services</strong> because they assumed the kids were being <strong>abused</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>

  <li>If a child is "abused," it has been very badly mistreated, either physically or emotionally.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s with the attitude</strong>? I just need <strong>cool</strong>, I need quiet.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>"What's with the attitude?" is a slangy way of asking a person why they have such a bad attitude or are in such a bad mood.</li>
  <li>In this case, "cool" is a way of saying calm or perhaps cooperative.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>So when can I get a <strong>frickin</strong> answer? :: Don&rsquo;t talk to me like that!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Frickin&rdquo; is a more gentle way of saying fucking, but it&rsquo;s still crude.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Figuring out</strong> who takes Randy to <strong>roller hockey</strong> is probably easier at Randy&rsquo;s house. Now <strong>cool it</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; means to find a solution to a problem.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Roller Hockey&rdquo; is a sport similar to hockey that&rsquo;s played with roller skates.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Cool it&rdquo; is a an excellent way to tell a child or anyone else to stop acting so rudely or disagreeably.</li>

<p><em>Erin, it&rsquo;s great to meet you. You&rsquo;ve done a <strong>fabulous</strong> job.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A good alternative to excellent or wonderful.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Did I ever tell you about that airline case? ::What <strong>the fuck</strong> are you talking about?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that "the fuck" is added to Wh questions to show emotion such as anger or frustration. This is much cruder than "the hell."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I got <strong>my ass kicked</strong> by this guy. He just buried me in paper. <strong>Brutal</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To kick a person&rsquo;s ass&rdquo; is to physically hurt them, or in this case, completely defeat them in a lawsuit.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Brutal&rdquo; is a powerful adjective that means very cruel or ruthless.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This guy was the <strong>toughest</strong> <strong>mother</strong> I&rsquo;d ever been <strong>up against</strong>. :: <strong>Make a point</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Tough&rdquo; is strong or difficult to defeat, and in this case, &ldquo;mother&rdquo; is a somewhat crude slang word for a disagreeable person.</li>
  <li>If you are &ldquo;up against&rdquo; a person, you are competing or fighting against them.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Make a point&rdquo; is Erin&rsquo;s way of telling Ed to say what he is really trying to say.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t <strong>hesitate</strong> now! We did all the fucking work!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To hesitate&rdquo; to do something is to pause before doing it, or to consider not doing it at all.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>PG&amp;E has requested that we <strong>submit</strong> to <strong>binding arbitration</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to &ldquo;submit&rdquo; to do something is to agree to do it.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Binding arbitration&rdquo; is a legal term which refers to a decision by both parties in a potential lawsuit, in which it is agreed that all the facts are given to a single judge, and that judge decides the outcome of the case.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s where we try the case without a <strong>jury</strong>, just before a judge.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A group of citizens who witness a trial in order to decide the result.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The judge&rsquo;s decision is final. There is no <strong>appeal</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; is a legal term that refers to the decision of the loser in a suit (or a person who has been found guilty of a crime) to try and reverse the decision by going to a higher level court.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Each one <strong>gets a go</strong> before the judge to determine <strong>damages</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, to &ldquo;get a go&rdquo; before the judge is to get a an opportunity to talk and present facts and evidence.</li>
  <li>In a legal context, &ldquo;damages&rdquo; refers to the amount of money that a person is awarded for the harm they suffered because of the defendant&rsquo;s actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>PG&amp;E has proposed they&rsquo;re <strong>liable</strong> for anywhere between $50 and 400 million.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>To be "liable" for something is to be legally responsible for having done it, and to be responsible for the damages that it may have been caused.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Let me get this straight</strong>. :: If we went to trial, PG&amp;E could stretch this over 10 years with appeal after appeal.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>"Let me get this straight" is a common way of saying "I want to make sure I completely understand." Here, Erin is trying to understand how PG&amp;E could use legal tactics to prevent paying their victims for years.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We have a lot of work to do before we even <strong>broach</strong> that subject.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To broach&rdquo; a subject is to discuss it for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why don&rsquo;t I take Erin down the hall and I&rsquo;ll <strong>fill her in on</strong> all the details.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To fill a person in on&rdquo; something is to tell them about it.</li>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To fill in the holes&rdquo; in a person&rsquo;s research is to find those important facts that are still missing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>No offense</strong>. There&rsquo;s probably just some things we need to know that you didn&rsquo;t know to ask.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A short way of telling a person &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t talk to me like I&rsquo;m an <strong>idiot</strong>, OK?</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Wanted to be a swimmer, so she spent every minute she could in the PG&amp;E pool. She had a <strong>tumor</strong> on her <strong>brain stem</strong> <strong>detected</strong> last November.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Note that many people speak in elliptical grammar, so that the pronoun at the beginning is dropped (&ldquo;<em>She</em> wanted&hellip;&rdquo;).</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;tumor&rdquo; is a lump in the body that has cancerous cells, and the &ldquo;brain stem&rdquo; is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord.</li>
  <li>If something is &ldquo;detected,&rdquo; it is discovered, often with the use of sensitive tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>An operation with <strong>radiation</strong> <strong>shrunk</strong> it after that.</em></p>
<ul>

  <li>If a medical condition is &ldquo;chronic,&rdquo; it lasts for a long time.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Nausea&rdquo; is the feeling you have when you are sick to your stomach or feel like you are going to throw up.</li>
  <li>Note that a person &ldquo;undergoes&rdquo; (has) surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>OK, I think we <strong>got off on the wrong foot</strong> here.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To get off on the wrong foot&rdquo; is to start to do something in a very poor or unsuccessful way.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Just because she dresses like a lawyer doesn&rsquo;t mean she didn&rsquo;t <strong>work her ass off</strong> in law school.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person &ldquo;works their ass off,&rdquo; they work extremely hard.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Excuse me for not going to law school. :: Law school?! At this point, I&rsquo;d <strong>settle for</strong> <strong>charm school</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to settle for&rdquo; something is to agree to accept it, even though it is not a great or ideal choice.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Charm school&rdquo; is place where people learn to behave well by learning to be polite and graceful.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>OK, now, if you could walk me through all of the <strong>elements</strong> of Anabelle&rsquo;s <strong>illnesses</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;elements&rdquo; are facts, and an &ldquo;illness&rdquo; is a disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Specific details, when the <strong>symptoms</strong> began&hellip;.<strong>prior to</strong> the first medical visit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Symptoms&rdquo; are the outward signs of a disease, such as headaches or fever. &ldquo;Prior to&rdquo; is another way of saying before.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you could <strong>reserve</strong> <strong>sentimental embellishments</strong>, I&rsquo;d appreciate it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;to reserve&rdquo; means to avoid, but it is never used this way (To reserve a table at a restaurant is the way it is most commonly used).</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Sentimental embellishments&rdquo; are emotional stories or details that are not completely true, but a little exaggerated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>She&rsquo;s kind of <strong>stuck up</strong>, and she <strong>upsets</strong> Annabelle.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;stuck up,&rdquo; they are arrogant, elitist or snobby.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To upset&rdquo; a person is to make them angry, worried or disturbed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Everyone is pretty upset about the <strong>arbitration</strong> thing.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Arbitration&rdquo; is a legal word for the act of letting an independent judge decide who should win a lawsuit, instead of a jury.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m telling you the truth and I will <strong>get to the bottom of this</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To get to the bottom of&rdquo; something is to find out what the real cause is of a situation, or what is really happening outside of public view.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not a strong case. What I am saying is that we still don&rsquo;t have <strong>a smoking gun</strong> that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;A smoking gun&rdquo; is good expression that means a strong piece of evidence which proves illegal behavior (In this case, which shows PG&amp;E executives in San Francisco knew of the Hinkley problem).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bullshit! If I was on my <strong>death bed</strong>, if it helped you, you&rsquo;d drag me out of it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Naturally enough, the bed on which a person prepares to die.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You stuck me in Siberia <strong>dictating</strong> to some god damn <strong>steno clerk</strong> so you could finish this without me.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To dictate&rdquo; a letter is to say it out loud so that a secretary can type it.</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;steno clerk&rdquo; is a secretary who types letters that are dictated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>They <strong>screwed up</strong>, Erin! Do I have your attention now? They admit it.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To screw up&rdquo; something is to do it very badly, or completely fail at it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The <strong>arbitration proposal</strong> they sent might as well have been written in <strong>Sanskrit</strong>, for all the sense it made to the people in Hinkley.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An &ldquo;arbitration proposal&rdquo; is a letter suggesting to parties in a lawsuit that the case be decided by a judge.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Sanskrit&rdquo; is an ancient language, and thus this is Ed&rsquo;s way of saying there is no way the plaintiffs could have understood the proposal since it was so poorly written.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>She called us <strong>thieves</strong>. They&rsquo;re all listening to her. The whole thing is about to <strong>fall apart</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;thief&rdquo; is a person who steals things from others.</li>
  <li>If a plan &ldquo;falls apart,&rdquo; it collapses, fails completely or self-destructs.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re emotional, you&rsquo;re <strong>erratic</strong>. You say any god damn thing that comes into your head. You make this <strong>personal</strong> and it isn&rsquo;t.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;erratic,&rdquo; they are easily changeable or emotionally unstable.</li>
  <li>If a person makes their job &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; they get too emotional about it, rather than seeing it as just part of work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Binding</strong> arbitration isn&rsquo;t all that different from a trial. It&rsquo;s <strong>overseen</strong> by a judge, and evidence is presented in much the same way.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If something is &ldquo;binding,&rdquo; it must be obeyed.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;To oversee&rdquo; a trial is to direct or guide it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>No jury and no appeal.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In binding arbitration, one judge makes the last, final decision!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Which is it? There&rsquo;s a big difference there. ::I wouldn&rsquo;t like <strong>to speculate</strong> at this point.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To speculate&rdquo; is to try and make an educated guess about something (Here, how much money PG&amp;E will have to pay).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Those of you about to leave, I&rsquo;d like you <strong>to keep this date in mind</strong>. 1978. That&rsquo;s the year of the <strong>Love Canal</strong> controversy.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;To keep something in mind&rdquo; is to think about it.</li>
  <li>Love Canal is the name of famous neighborhood in Niagra Falls, New York in which many people got cancer because of a horrible case of industrial pollution.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Is this a big decision? Absolutely. But I do not believe that this is a <strong>sell out</strong>. This is the <strong>best shot</strong> of getting everyone some money now.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; is the act of agreeing to do something for the money, even if it is against a person&rsquo;s principles or beliefs.</li>
  <li>Your &ldquo;best shot&rdquo; is your best opportunity to try and do something.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This still leaves us about 150 <strong>short</strong>. :: Oh shit.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of saying 150 below the minimum number needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ll have to go <strong>door to door</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a salesman goes &ldquo;door to door,&rdquo; they knock at every house in a neighborhood in order to talk to the people inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll give you some money for a <strong>cab</strong> if you want to go there.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>An alternative word for a taxi.</li>

<p><em>The <strong>figure&rsquo;s</strong> not exactly what we discussed.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;figure&rdquo; is another word for number.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>After careful consideration, I felt that figure was not <strong>appropriate</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Appropriate&rdquo; is an important word meaning correct, suitable or right.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do you know why people think all lawyers are <strong>back-stabbing</strong>, <strong>blood-sucking</strong> <strong>scumbags</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A truly great insult! If a person is &ldquo;back-stabbing,&rdquo; they build your trust and when you turn around, they hurt you.</li>
  <li>A person who is &ldquo;blood-sucking&rdquo; is a parasite--someone who lives off the life of another without contributing anything.</li>
  <li>Finally, a &ldquo;scumbag&rdquo; is a disgusting, immoral person (Scum is the filth on bathroom tile).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re doing this to me now, when I&rsquo;m <strong>up to my ass</strong> in <strong>Kettleman plaintiffs</strong>, which looks like double the amount we had in Hinkley.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a person is &ldquo;up to their ass&rdquo; in something, they have so much of it that they may be overwhelmed.</li>
  <li>In this case, &ldquo;Kettleman plaintiffs&rdquo; are people suing in another pollution case (in the town of Kettleman) that Ed and Erin are working on.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You expect me to get these people to trust me with their lives&hellip;and the whole time you&rsquo;re <strong>screwing me</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this context, &ldquo;to screw&rdquo; a person is to mistreat them or abuse them (In other contexts, to screw means to have sex).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It is not about the number. It is about <strong>how my work is valued</strong> in this firm.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is Erin&rsquo;s way of saying that she doesn&rsquo;t care how much she is paid, but she does want to be appreciated for working so hard.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do they teach <strong>beauty queens</strong> how to apologize? Because <strong>you suck at it</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>A &ldquo;beauty queen&rdquo; is a woman who wins a beauty contest, such as the Miss Wichita contest.</li>
  <li>If a person &ldquo;sucks&rdquo; at something, they are very bad at it. This verb is very slangy, crude and common.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Erin and Ed have seven other cases pending&hellip;.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>If a case is &ldquo;pending,&rdquo; it is still waiting to be decided or settled.</li>

  <p>1. Erin is a complicated person; What are her good features, and what are her bad ones?</p>
<p>2.  Ed gets 40% of whatever his clients win in a lawsuit; Is that way too much, or does that seem fair? How would it work in your country?</p>
<p>3. Can you think of similar situations in your country in which a big company has been caught poisoning the air or water? What happened?
  What should  have happened?</p>
<p>4. What does Erin originally think of lawyers?
  How does this film portray lawyers?</p>
<p>5. What are the various people or institutions in a society that can
  prevent the kind of tragedy that took place in Hinkley?</p>
