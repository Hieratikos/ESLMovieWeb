<div class="w3-container">
  <p><p>
    Will Hunting is a 20 year old Boston janitor who works cleaning classrooms
    at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the best and most famous
    universities in the world. He is an orphan who grew up in various foster homes,
    where he had been physically abused as a child. He is also an extraordinarily
    gifted mathematical genius, who likes to solve math problems that an MIT professor
    writes on a hallway chalkboard. For the students, these problems are too difficult
    to solve, but for Will, they're easy!
<p>
  One day, Prof. Lambeau sees Will writing the answer to a problem on the chalkboard,
  but Will runs away before they can talk. Lambeau soon discovers many disturbing things
  about Will, including the fact that he is stuck in jail for having just physically
  attacked someone who had beaten him up many years earlier. Lambeau arranges with a
  judge to keep Will out of jail,  as long as Will agrees to work on mathematical problems
  and to get psychological help. Will agrees to these conditions.
<p>
    Will is too difficult a patient for the various psychologists that Lambeau asks to help,
    but eventually Lambeau goes to his old friend Sean Maguire, who is teaching psychology
    at a local community collage. Sean has many of his own problems to face, including the
    fact that his wife of 17 years had recently died from cancer. Still, he agrees to work
    with Will, and while the relationship is extremely difficult and emotionally explosive,
    Sean sticks with it because he is convinced he can help Will find some stability and happiness.
<p>
  Over the next few months, Will becomes romantically involved with Skylar, a British student
  at Harvard University who has decided to go Medical School at Stanford University in California.
  Skylar falls in love with Will, and wants him to go with her to California, but Will is too
  scared to become emotionally vulnerable and too scared to leave Boston and his friends.
  <p>
    In the end, Lambeau simply wants Will to get a job where he would use his mathematical talent,
    and even Chuckie wants Will to find a life for himself that is far from the difficult working
    class lives that they both have now. Ultimately though, it is Sean who patiently gives Will
    the courage and direction he really needs to move on with his life.

  <p><strong>New Words and Expressions:</strong></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><em>I know many of you had this as <strong>undergraduates.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>In American universities, education is divided into "undergraduate," which is usually when students work on
    Bachelor's degrees, and "graduate," where they work on advanced degrees such as a Master's or Ph.D.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>It won't hurt to <strong>brush up.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A nice little phrasal verb meaning to review, or study something again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>The person to do so...<strong>will be in my good graces.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>An old fashioned but pretty way of saying that "I will be very appreciative to this person."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>"The <strong>auspicious</strong> <strong>MIT Tech</strong>."</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Auspicious" is an interesting adjective implying good fortune in the future.</li>
  <li>The "MIT Tech" is MIT's oldest and largest newspaper.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Nobel laureates, Fields Medal winners, renowned Astrophysicists...</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>The first refers to those who have won the world famous Nobel Prizes.</li>
  <li>The Fields Medal is the highest award a mathematician can receive. Awarded every four years to mathematicians who have made great contributions in the field before their 40th birthday.</li>
  <li>"Renowned" is a useful adjective meaning prominent or widely respected. Astro-physicists (like Einstein) study the laws of the universe.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>...and <strong>lowly</strong> MIT professors</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>An excellent adjective meaning humble or unimportant, and often used in a sarcastic (joking) manner when referring to oneself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Fuck you, and your Irish <strong>curse.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "curse" is a superstition of bad luck placed on a person by someone with magical powers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Like I'd waste my energy spreading my legs for that <strong>Tootsie Roll</strong> <strong>dick</strong>? Go home and give it a <strong>tug</strong> yourself!</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Note the use of "like" at the beginning of sentences, used (and overused!) by many young people for "as if." The rest of the sentence is a crude sexual insult, since a "tootise roll" is a small piece of well known candy, and a "dick" is very common for penis.</li>
  <li>"To tug" means to pull, and thus the last sentence implies "go home and masturbate with your tiny penis."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>It's like <strong>five to two</strong> Morgan ends up marrying her.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A common way of suggesting the odds of something happening if you wanted to bet on it (ie...A race horse may be "3 to 1").</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>There's only so many times you can <strong>bang</strong> your friend's future wife</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To bang" someone is an old-fashioned and silly verb meaning to have sex with.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I'm going to <strong>take off</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>An excellent phrasal verb meaning to leave. Use it!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>"Stop brushing me back!"</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Stop throwing the ball so close to me like you are going to hit me."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>"Stop crowding the plate!"</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Stop standing so close to the plate like you want to get hit."</li>
  <li>In this exchange, each one is blaming the other for poor sportsmanship.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Hey, <strong>what's up</strong>? You still tough? <strong>Come on!</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Two of the greatest phrasal verbs in English. "What's up?" is a standard way to greet someone, and essentially means "what's new in your life?" "Come on" is the most versatile phrasal verb in English, and can mean everything from "stop lying" to "hurry up," or as in this case, "show me you can do it."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Theorem.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A statement that can be demonstrated by previously proven statements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Who's the girl with the <strong>striped</strong> pants? She's got <strong>a nice ass</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"Striped" is a useful adjective referring to a pattern of rows, often on clothes (or Zebras!)</li>
  <li>The second sentence is a compliment, though a bit forward. An "ass," as you know, is a butt or rear end.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I hate that little <strong>bitch</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A crude but common term, usually used for an unpleasant or mean woman.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>That kid used <strong>to beat the shit out of me</strong> in <strong>kindergarten</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>"To beat the shit out of someone" is a vulgar way of saying beat up, or physically attack.</li>
  <li>"Kindergarten" is preschool for 3-5 year old children.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>It's 15 minutes <strong>out of our way.</strong></em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A very useful expression meaning "in a different direction from where we are going." Often, people argue whether it is worth going to a place if it's considered too far out of the way.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Would you shut <strong>the fuck</strong> up?</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A delightful use of "fuck" as a noun, added for emotional flavor. Very vulgar, but common (Note the use of "fucking" as an adjective throughout the movie, as in "my fucking sandwich").</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Stop being a <strong>prick</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Very vulgar. Could mean literally a penis, but more generally, used for a jerk or ass.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>We'll put your fucking sandwich <strong>on layaway</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A financial expression meaning to pay for something each month over an extended period of time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>I think you should establish <strong>a good line of credit</strong>.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Access to money, often through a bank loan. "A good line of credit" is the goal of every good middle class American.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Hold up</strong>, Chuck.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>In this case, meaning stay, or slow down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>So without further ado...</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A fancy way to say "Without speaking more..." during a speech</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Come forward, silent <strong>rogue</strong>, and receive <strong>thy</strong> prize.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>A "rogue" is an educated word for an unprincipled person who behaves badly.</li>
  <li>"Thy" is used only poetically, or in a speech such as this, since it is old Shakespearean English for "your."</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>The <strong>gauntlet</strong> has been thrown down.</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Another poetic way to say "the challenge has been made (or accepted)." A "gauntlet" is, curiously, a glove used in medieval times, and is almost never used today except in this expression.</li>
  </ul>

<p><em>Hey, <strong>fuck you</strong>!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In case you didn't know, the most common direct obscenity in all of English.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Oh, you're a <strong>clever</strong> one.</em></p>

<li>A nice little word for smart, or possibly creative.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How hard is it to push a motherfucking <strong>broom</strong> around?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The object used to sweep floors. Note that the obscene adjective before "broom" is extremely vulgar, but not that uncommon among certain types of people.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I got <strong>fired</strong> because management was <strong>restructuring.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To fire" someone is to tell someone they can no longer work at the job they had.</li>
<li>"Restructuring" has become a common word in this context, meaning that the company has reorganized itself, often firing workers in the process.
  Will is making a joke because he got fired for breaking the law.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Retards.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A crude abbreviation for "retarded," referring to mentally handicapped people with very low intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You get canned more than tuna, bitch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A semi-clever play on words. "Canned" means to be laid-off or fired from a job, and of course, to be literally put in cans.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I though there would be <strong>equations</strong> and shit on the walls.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical formulas.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I will take a <strong>pitcher</strong> of the finest <strong>lager</strong> <strong>in the house</strong>.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>A tired and overused way to introduce oneself at a bar or other place where people come to socialize.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It must have been a <strong>survey</strong> course.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Note the grammatical construction for a logical deduction in the past (Must+have+been, though pronounced by Chuckie as "musta' been...").</li>
<li> A "survey course" is an introductory class.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I found the class....<strong>elementary</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One way to say simple, or too easy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It was just between <strong>recess</strong> and lunch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A term used in elementary schools for the time period when students can go out and play in the school yard. The guy is mocking Chuckie.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I was hoping you can give me some <strong>insight</strong> into the evolution of the market economy of the Southern economies...</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Insight" is a nice word for intelligent observations, or analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Of course, that's your <strong>contention</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A good word for belief, or claim.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Hang on a second.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A good way to slow somebody down when you need time to think, or as here, when you object to what someone is saying.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That's going to last until next year, when you're going to be in here <strong>regurgitating</strong> Gordon Wood.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To regurgitate" is a great verb meaning to spit back out, used for both food and ideas. Wood, Garrison and Vickers are the names of history writers that appear in the dialog about this point in the film. Will is very directly telling the other man that he is unoriginal, unintelligent, and lazy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You going to <strong>plagiarize</strong> the whole thing for us?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To plagiarize" is a powerful verb meaning to copy or steal another person's writing or other artistic expression. Something none of my students ever do.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Do you have any thoughts on this matter...or...<strong>is that your thing</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A colloquial way to ask "Is this what you enjoy?"</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You dropped 150 <strong>grand</strong> on a fucking education you could have gotten for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is one of Will's great lines. A "grand" is $1,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It's <strong>cool</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A critical, great colloquial adjective. Used to mean fun, nice, enjoyable, or as here, "not a problem."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My boy is <strong>wicked</strong> smart!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting adjective that most often simply means evil, although here it is used as an adverb to mean "extremely." Commonly used in the Boston area.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The <strong>heavy-set</strong> girl said I have a <strong>receding hairline</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Heavy-set" is a somewhat polite way to say overweight, heavy or possibly big-boned.</li>
<li>A "receding hairline" refers to a growing loss of hair above the forehead.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I was, <strong>like</strong>, "go fuck yourself!"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A grammatically pointless word that is extremely common among many people, especially when used with the verb "to be." Be aware of it, but avoid using it too often.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You're an <strong>idiot</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A very common noun for a stupid or ridiculous person.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That guy over there...the Michael Bolton <strong>clone.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting and useful word from biology which describes someone that looks or behaves exactly like someone else. Michael Bolton is a famous singer. Lousy, but famous.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Maybe we could just <strong>get together</strong> and eat a bunch of <strong>caramels</strong>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"To get together" is an excellent phrasal verb meaning to meet and/or spend time together. Caramels are delicious little candies made by overcooking sugar.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>It's as <strong>arbitrary</strong> as drinking coffee.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is an excellent word meaning "determined by whim or personal desire, and not by law or principle."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Well, I got her number! <strong>How do you like them apples?!</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A wonderful but very old-fashioned expression in the form of a question, which is used when you expect the listener to be surprised or angry or perhaps amazed. Will is mocking the other guy for not being chosen by the attractive female.</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

  <ul>
  <li>Will would have said "What the fuck...?" Most young people will compromise and say "What the hell...?" / "What the heck...?" is very old-fashioned and conservative, as is the use of the preposition "in" preceding it. If you want to add emotion, stick with "what the hell...?"</li>
